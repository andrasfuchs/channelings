been doing a lot of implementation of new Energies new frequency and what was finding is it you doing a lot of processing some of these systems is feeling a bit overloaded in the last week we going to have to delete a prize if you feel that things are a bit heavier part of that is just that there's a little shifting around these energy as good as a result you feel like your. I have something in the dirt and creating a big jump ball around doing the ductus tackling right now so we are here to the silicate that as we working with you today we are actually working with stone and sound so it's not that we speaking with one particular dialect and sounds resonate with you at a cellular level so what all supporting you that way and it's important for you to know that because consuming of a good amount of water as you go will weed help to move a lot of the energies through the body because as your shifting as energetic template you also shipping its physical body in this is in part what has been going on for a while if we're talking about over the course of the last several weeks it's starting to feel it through the water is going to help you to integrate water before you consume it or we use the word you can think about programming the water with intention whatever it is he would like to be experiencing weather that's clarity or weather that is inspiration peace joy vitality balance whatever it is that you like to experience not working with energy and pouring it into your water so that you don't have to do so much work in transmitting the entire liquid concentrated amount of energy that thing gets put in writing sells at a containing a different structure of the water molecule then raise the prequel the off they can increase their residence they will go up to match that of the program the water so if you can do that we would HIGHLY Holly on a highly recommend it that's going to help you over the course of the next several weeks so that its couple of the things we want to talk about it and it for some reason your question is not know that we hear your questions and that we will assist you in getting the answer we will help to put it in your physical reality and we will keep giving you those clues in those details and to you get it we know so the first thing we want to f*** that has to do with the energy of 2013 is your moving beyond that is 2014 2013 was a time of integration it was a period in which you were able to take a lot of the information that you had a quiet up in 2012 and then what you receive with the winter solstice of 2012 and you go to start implementing the new systems but it was also a time of saving energy as opposed to acting on an itchy sew a lot of what you were working with was the feminine energy really getting an opportunity to learn how to use that feminine energy 2014 you get to play around with using the masculine energy on many of you might say what does that look like what is that masculine energy look like from the from a higher level of masculine energy well it is different in that you are able toin taking more actions to reach out to meet the higher frequency so that's itso as you learn to open is that you'll be able to talk creating a monster that you want to hold you not really sure what that looks like to see it because what you're about to create ever and so you don't have a visual point of reference you don't have something that you can say you know I know and I would like to know so that you willbefore start working Warner with a frequency as opposed to working with the forum and we said this again and again and again and we know that maybe you view a thing if you've heard this before but this is absolutely what you must not doing you have to stop putting this into practice because what you will find is this what you will find it if you are operating in the old day it's going to take a really long time and you probably not going to be able to achieve the vibrational Heights that you are seeking because many of these new systems again. Look like anything that you have currently on the planet on so that forward momentum is required based off of frequency not formso as you start calling the bread crumbs at you and then you open back up because the universe isn't going to provide you with opportunity based solely on one thing at a time the universe brings you multiple things to work on it wants so you know it's so it's not as if you're just going to work solely on say creating a job and I know there are many things that you want to work on some times at the same time sometimes you know you might be a job in a couple hours later you'll think it's it that has to do with personal relationships so it's taking that and then going back into the feminine mode of reception will you open back up you allow yourself to see what is in front of you and you see something else it looks like as it seems like that thing that you likeand then you start using that divine masculine energy again and then you you keep going over and over and over again will he will vacillate between utilizing the feminine and masculine and that's how you start utilizing divine masculine moon 2014 and a fine balance between the two what gender you are but you embody both masculine and feminine this is why because it's it's needed in balance in the purpose of creation I need to nurture both of those things within you to go ahead and start taking questions alright so burn we will see way you like to go where you don't Toledocan you hear me okay I didn't raise my hand I did not ask questions so I'm quite surprised if we don't need to put you on the spotI really love more time to bathe in porta and sit in the bathtub flowers over a used to and now I'm hesitant off you know going into water so I need something wrong with me or is this just another way of integration is the part of the energy that comes up with you around water is there the cleansing process happens and so as you are putting itself back around water you kind of reached saturation. There is part of you that says know if I release to watch app is this too much power then it's going to be too difficult or it's going to hurt so much right now so there's a fear of being isolatedhim being separate so as you start working with that that it safe to connect it safe to be in my body that's going to help you so that you are able to process some of that bit you don't water is a wonderful elements in order to clear out your energetic field of view when you clear it out it just feels way too intense which is why you continue them yourself with drugs and food in television in a relationship so that one thing and that has to do around water so if you don't really have to know the ins and outs of that but we say persecution is part of that Lifetime in which you would round that is coming out to be processed and you start working with knowing again that they have to be in the body and it safe to connect that will help you through persecution issues in this lifetime on in our lifetimebecause that actually will help a lot of people just think you please help me to know my next steps in relationship with my children's father for relief from his abuse change myselfwhat can I do differently I feel like I would do anything including Union to whatever he wants as long as it would be good for my children please right now and for you to continue working with because this is no one shot deal yeah it's forgiveness for old but he has done right and all his limitations and also giving yourself for the times you felt that you were not able to use your voice that you would not able to speak of truth and you know you're working with this year you're working through the process utilizing your voice and being here and Bambi's is a big issue for many of you and you arereally working on that we can acknowledge that are you see that in your field so in a very practical way we would suggest that you sit down and you you can work with forgiveness I think it myself and others wrong doings known and unknown to me in this lifetime internal of a lifetime about what it is you because some of the manipulation that happens in relationships happens because you have literally handed over your power to say no I don't want to make a decision I want you to do it on so that other person has lovingly agreed to play that role and they they have been fulfilled it and then you will get treated an activated saying UE mini lighted or lit something happen to you if somehow victimizedFox what's going to be best for my kids and I feel like that means figuring out how do you read about Greece today alright this is the limited amount of time that you can spin and see how that feels do this no one right or wrong answer so we're not going to give you an answer of yes you need to take it all the way oh no you shouldn't this is this is one path that you go to work when you round to see where that hungry feels because it was very and vary as they age how much interaction they they have how much they choose to have what kind of license do they choose to build sofa now you know it's you checking in say where are my boundaries and knowing that children also create the same way that adults do it big soles and little buddiesyou know it's in park honoring what they are creating because those are situations and snoring is it going to help them grow hold the best frequency that you can for parties involved knowing that everybody has the potential to change and everyone has the potential to make what you will cool quote unquote better choices Hyatt choices for loving choices and it starts with speaking your truth about where you're concerned comes from not necessarily accusatory but just simply I feel this not that someone else makes you feel that way when you do this it makes me feel that that will put somebody in the defensive so it is just simply say I feel this way and cure my concerns and then start having an open dialogue about itwhen you get rid of clear about where you are boundaries are and that you start a certain your power in conversational in interaction with another person who in the past may been a bit like a steamroller or may have been abusive they can't play the frequency out with you in the same way it's absolutely impossible but what will happen so it all starts within you and that can change the dynamic and that will help on how you want to work in the relationship with the family dynamics with children with a with the parents with yourself and with their father issues but we would simply say speaking your truththe three things that we would say are your homework assignment my intentions are unclear boundaries it safe to speak my truth and then we gave to you about what forgiveness feels like and how its appearance and at what level you are experiencing it because it may be that if first you find it really difficult it feels really eat in Cecilia but go ahead and work with it just keep going with it and eventually you will feel that it was pretty light it feels good it feelsloving because of the end of the day if you can remember this what you're playing in here ready is an illusion of life that's all of these muscle this feel this to play this version of reality out then even if somebody is doing the most heinous thing that you can possibly imagine they're still contributing to the collective to Universal Records what that vibration is like does it mean if more people have to go there and buy the benefit of them exploring its they don't have to show signs of food for that role because it is impossible to play in a dualistic playgrounds without somebody playing that. It's just impossible to somebody's going to do it and is used in frequency it's not surprisingfull house and what will eventually happen if he will have separation for those who want to stay a lower frequencies and those who want to move onto a higher when it's not right it's not long is vibrational exploration in its which choice do you want to make many of you who you are so many of you are finding that you've never had physical issues before and all the sudden coughing up for the group that will working with it's not surprising because most of you tend to be out of bodies u10 Natsuready care to be in them too much to be on it you'd rather be out of your body playing in the still around because you're you are so oriented beings in order to do what you came here to do so many of you over the course of 2013 and hears you haven't 2014 of finding you have physical ailments that never had before problems with your body when your body's been relatively healthy and strong and then also because you will have heightened your sensitivity the frequency you also finding the in E minor imbalance feels really huge Sophie you what could be a relatively minor in balance feels like a major illness because somebody else who's resonating at a much lower level they probably not going to notice it all because it to dance to feeling which was you you know 5 years ago was 10 years agoso grounded and connecting to the body is really really really really important we cannot stress the importance of it and not eat what it's like to ground and connect with the body because you know you have to use your senses to determine that is going to be a different interpretation for all of you but one of the easiest ways we can get you to that point of recognition is recognized when you're not in it and this is more common and you know it it's like you walking into a room where we are sisters. Full because it's it applies oh love you but you're walking into another room and you realize that you have no recollection of why you they're taking you to the room and then why would indicated that you not grounded in connectedfeel like that can also be caused by being not fully connected not always but sometimes so we would say check in when you start to recognize that disconnection then you can move that energy to connection and how do you do that sort of visualization that it puts the emphasis of the focus on the body will get you into the body so if you want to visualize and white light coming in a moving through the entire body you can do that you can imagine of beautiful golden light coming in through the crown of the head in each and every cell in just like a little Sun going supernova it goes into the next cell where the process occurs again and again and again until it was all the way through it down and out through the body to the core of the earth comes back in the same process happens on the way back up as well asthe earthly you know anything that's going to get your attention especially if you're saying I'm doing it to get in the body that certain things to do that with old physical illnesses and ailments in the body it really comes down to lack of love lack of self law that sit at its base and then there are lots of other variations on the theme Salty's that you weave in their I'm not love them not supported on them good enough I'm not deserving I need to be punished you know all the many wonderful things that the endocrine and health with and and those programs become habitual a week and you and a jet templates and then that we can see cells in the body would show up as illnessthat you feel that you can even function sometimes you feel like you can't even get out of bed so you might be lacking in a vitamin or a mineral or so much as you start to put better things into the body to support shoe then you can start to do with some of the emotional and mental components that's the first place to start so we go ahead what are some of the specific questions about illness that you got their feelingswhere you can work with some of the crystals crystals are holding the frequency is fish it when you are working with human arms eating those 2248 crystals to work with because they're holding up earth and its he go to stones or another but you can also play it work with because they hold that grounding residents so if you would not an alignment with that is easy to find the frequency the same thing with the water when the water gets program if you not automatically in a line that you are infusing that energy into the water you go through to infuse the water now it may be that you program the water and then you go outside and you start having interactions with otherwhen you come back 30 minutes later and your idiot that if you drink the water you put in that signal that vibration into the heart of you at the level that says wait a minute or twoyou know there's a lot of water energy so many of you that can make you feel a bit addressed and not really grounded working with the elements of earth air fire those elements it going to help you a bit more than they air or water because water going to make you feel like you want to go out workingit's letting go of the past that said we would say if someone says your licenseand if there's a need for control what am I going to be responsible for things that I don't want to be responsible for in particular to this question is a big issue because you are taking a responsibility of others that doesn't belong to you and you feel that as you arethe creation of those events and the collective agreement maybe that you that the event will for sale from from both of those examples from other lifetimes so as you start working more more that live there is a party that says ooh I have more light I have my wisdom to be responsible and then this is where I wasn't good enough so now I have to control all that and so that's where you getting a lot of this clamping down in the area of the third chakra with the knowledge and when is that it is safe to connect it safe to be in my body and I'm only was also with my own thoughts feelings and actions others are responsible for their own thoughts feelings and actions you can go from there before they are things thatat the mental and the mental and emotional levels working at the energetic level working with the thoughts feelings and emotions what your drawings to introduce into the physical body or counter with the physical body meaning your food your environment they're matching and frequencies so if you're getting cleaner if you will or you integrating in Indiana the body wants to do the same thing to or you won't be placed in an environment that has toxic materials you won't be in those or if it's not as if you encounter that kind of thing at a lower when is it going to take it onall things must be changed absolutely and then the sum of the physical things in life that you create two really reinforce new belief systems and has changed but it really get shoe to wear with it on a regular basis so that they are eating and grinding a lesson for us feeling like you're in divine alignment really opening up your connection to source energy straighten itself and that's going to require you to do itand that constant energy flow is that will straighten the spine but if you're not saying that he's going to let go you go to let go of the expectation I'm really just focus on knowing that you would like to have the greatest clearest connection to source that you can possibly have the physical then will start to align with it because we understand the desire to have the buddy in quote unquote perfect working order but often what will happen if the if you had a good working order in perfect alignment chances are you know you would hold it it would go back and do you create these more dramatic incidents to work through a lock on so that it's a constant so that you start to really work with that in a carwhat we do see progress we do see the work that you doing look at and pay attention to how you feel you're out of alignment with others meaning also had separate how you difference that you feel like you because you're so that also can show up as a quote-unquote misalignment and and not will also help to reinforce that belief in the spine trying to see that the role of the same that you are a vine being of lighthow come I noticed that I've been very 16th of November and I'm trying to do all the things that I've been known in the city cu wishes to be positive but I know if I go to an exercise class I know this I got sick and my friends when they're having a bad time forgot to make me out of question would be you know how do I make sure that is recognized and holding those thoughts that they're fully capable of healing and holding another frequency as opposed to worrybecause as soon as you start worrying your pulse is something wrong other people worried about my condition so integration and they're perfectly capable of health and well-being is affecting that they are those things that will help support them a check in to see what's really going on in the moments we know what was seen but full of you is back checking in frequency is it something that would cause me to be vibrating where I am or are those around me vibrating with that energy and I just dropped out smack it and there's a difference when you really ask yourself if I'm on another person caught me off in the caryou know things to do I go right when I went to the store or my conversation with my friend it was it was fun seeing you remind me that everything for you and then all the sudden you know that's the difference so now it with you if part of what you're going through is just being really easy with the body and checking in on your limits because all of you right now undergoing a transformation at the cellular level so you might feel the need at times to sleep more you may feel that you don't have the vitality to go out and run a couple miles like you normally do or to take that aerobic class if you feel because the body's asked you not to expand as much energy on the same timethe physical activities it is asking you to rest a bit more so all that extra energy can go to clearing out the cells and using it to detox you have an excuse not to move but you justify to yourselves could not running around and doing everything for everybody you taking time to you sew them or you can do that in the dated a moment to moment awareness the less you're going to find me the less you going to find you create these big events that require you to be flat out alright make science more water for you if you can get more water into the body that can help you and and also share with you next time it's not just for children and a 15-minute Matthew can make all the difference in the world it will help reset it will help you reach aroundI'm part of you already knows how to do that so you are learning working withtrusting that you already have the tools you already have the capabilities that was your thinking about it and you can visualize that you can send it towards that water that will be enough he will be able to do that earlier about 2013 game where we not only move ahead and now we're getting looking for a new modality to to go and study and add what I'm doing currently and I still feel like there's several options and I'm having a hard time figuring out what to do nextwill you go to the bottom line he said if the internal med ality that you discover that going to be the most fun and the most rewarding some of what you being shown the new modalities that got bit pieces but they don't have the whole thingwe're going to get the greatest inspiration about how to work when you go inside we always say it's a bit like climbing scaffolding that that rich wore that structure what a class but only take you so far and then you know you climbed up to the top of it and fly from there and that means going inside to get the information so what are you sinking about a week and give you feedback on those sad but I'm currently doing it like the old it going on when I have a client and see what's holding them that you can work with into your intuition what happens when is that it gives you a fullback it gives you a process to work through and again start going into just getting informationsell any sort of a suit of development classes going to help you with that there are some that specialize in looking at the police so any sort of medical intuitive but they all come down to you utilizing your own internal structure to read frequency not how you choose to do that can be different if you make feel vibration and Sam's going to be really good to you by working with a general tone and what will happen when you make time sound is this it will bounce off of that person on that frequency will all for the original town and what comes back issue will give you the indicator you'll be able to read weather analysis where the town is absorbed and if they're really in need of it maybe absorb it doesn't get bounced back and that is a reading for you that's an indicator sometimes they may have toand then it will come back it will seem like a faster rate than that gives you an indicator it may be that it comes back to school because it's a program in there and that program is making a distortion out of that time so that's what she work with stone and sound as a visual person that maybe something you see if you are a queer Audient it may be that you hear what the problem is you guys maybe they're giving you assistance their medical team if you will your your angelic provide information and you may be. Each one of you it's different which of my physical senses do I most readily interpret frequent from ears eyes you can also get it throughbut what is usually easier and this has to do with your genetic coding but you can develop all of them so if your clairvoyant you can also learn to become clairvoyant Ascension Island which one of the strongest to you that you interpret vibration through what would you say that was so stealing and vision it's alright with you you getting a lot to your body and we would say that's probably the most challenging of the three because you not use to interpreting signals through the body you are all used to using eyes and ears all day long you can work with both of those trust what you hear so working with will be a great bow down Ice T again anything that is going to help you to increase your intuitive ability will allow you to bring the India practice and your healing practiceI'm just about any healing modality is going to take some time to help you think it's going to seem like your imagination often times it first Go With It this is how you develop all of it you get confirmation and that allows you to trust more and then you know if hit you take a step and then you get the feedback and you always pressing what you got it and sometimes the information and you haven't felt like my ego might have been in that a bitch that was really what I want to hear not what I was being open to hearit's a learning processdoes that help you very very powerful and in what is healing the body to be honest we think you're going to be bored many view as saying you know new physical ailments develop as we said put the focus on the body from the physical level it's is toxic load on the body but what was seen safety is the biggest issue that creates are the allergies in the NBAvalances that's the biggest reason it helps you actually the ground because when you stop thinking about allergies what do you know what is that put your focus on me so I think about that so if you can put yourself and know that it's safe to be there it's safe to be out in the world to ground to connect it safe to be in the body that's going to help you more than anything it's not so much do you like or a judgment in the sense of 2you know Keane on trees or you know it's it's it's dirty outside it's not clean you get muddy is not that kind of thing is more it safe to be in my body is to be on the planet it safe to connect with it that's why you're seeing it more you getting to the point where any minor and balances showing up as a bigger issue so it's it's allowing you to process through diet being aware of some of the foods in it that you might feel a bit more sensitive to that help you secondary level while you work on the emotional stuffbecause you don't feel like to see things in the same way alter your perception will it say any sort of mind altering drug is still mind oriented on we're going to work with his from the heart level so if you want to experience it it can give you another perspective of what's possible and then you need to start working from the heart level to achieve it because everything everything that you find in your technology all that's a reflection of you in a technology all those things a reflection of frequencies that you can achieve inside the body so our perspective is that you try to purify the body and only work with the highest frequency is possible because what happens when you start inducing drugs and chemicals in food is it to alter the chemical output of the bodyyou alter your neurotransmitters you alter your hormones and then you start feeling off balance where is your natural balance it all into it that you feel in order to expand you need to have a hit you need to know if you need to try different drugs with a great for exploration if that's what you want to do but in the long term it doesn't really serve you and we would say the same thing about physical health on for the relief of discomfort in body because there are many who are consuming marijuana to deal with some of the issues and it doesn't really work that way yes you can take away some of the pain and discomfort but as we've sensual time and time again about changing the energetic and unless you were doing work at that levelthe physical ailment will continue to come back and if you are just consuming marijuana for long periods of time that really is not good for the body because it it is a toxin of sorts especially you getting all of the chemicals the heavier elements into the lungs do not getting as much life force energy in so it it's it's a great recommendation but as we said it's beginning with talked about health if you are needing something to help you so that you can function the fine but you got to do the energetic work once you can function so that you can stop using the physical edge physical age he will paramount becausehow do I type my question but if I have to ask a guy out of my life and I feel good but very very short but I know that I have to say is that part of what we're seeingUlta and let it sit and then go back inside know that these b****** know that he is opposed to it and it's just an expiration frequency and it is such a great example of what you doing with your life because it's not right but everybody everybody's going to have that you need to them because of the people and enjoyed by more people that can translate energetically into money to some small extent it extends there a lot of other things you can do with your creativity at work to bring you a revenue stream so just be open so that it doesn't have to be in a traditional tattooing there are many who won face see some of your work will want to invite you to have service to dance to paint a piece of art or2 in a beat for the business it may be for the home but there are different strands that you are not even open to right now because you're afraid you work with that and
