Dale nine months to year and a second one data channel and I knew I was supposed to have pen and paper and I started automatic writing and it just kind of went from there and I started first working with my own angelic guides and other celestial beings who came in and I did that for us doubts about a year and it was becoming very cumbersome for me to channel and enter right because I was hearing all of the words well before the writing is coming out.  The writings will really slough and so I just had to stop and put the pen down and that's when the words came and went.  I made the transition that's in the ninth and it's not creating collective set out because they were waiting for me to start working verbally so that I can work with tenants because that's actually how they work though.  From then on.  They've been my primary guide and I have my antigenic eyes and said a special friends who turn out and being new things all the time when I have questions about statistic things new people sell out the 19th.  It's almost like having experts in different fields.  So it's been an interesting journey and it's hard to believe that it's been almost 20 years so people I talked to are at the rate of actually moving into opening themselves up to to channel and receive other beings and in their bodies do you have any suggestions or awareness is that you would like to share fear around channeling is probably one of the biggest clearly is the biggest hurdle to do that when I actually teach selling.  We spent hours working through it because all of the fears you have about channeling or connecting with beings and higher rounds and dimension in the same theater you have in this dimension without a human being and when you start to understand that it makes it much easier to clear and to work through those issues and in others that the Sierras's position that the day one and the guides to me that is extremely rare, and when it happens it is contracted.  There is an actual contract for it.  There there are a lot of fears about turning the volume on returning it out and then not being able to to turn it down.  I've never had that issue.  You know the guys are actually probably thinking just the opposite.  They wish that I turn it up a bit more that I can be of everything my own personal life, and that email to me it's probably the most normal and natural thing and it's something that all of us do all of the time channeling something that the 50 people can do and I laugh because I see people channeling throughout the day.  I'll overhear something in any of the subtle difference in the frequency that you can edit and you know and it was all have those experiences you might have given a friend advice and thought of goodness in a way that come from that was really deep and often times are either connecting with our guide or higher.  Our higher self so that we all do it, and it is becoming aware is that that that information is available, it just opening up and putting ourselves in our heart center and a lot of safety issues get triggered and painted.  The guys are really adamant about their perspective on protection and its and is not very popular.  A lot of people would like to see themselves in this beautiful cocoon of white light and have to be protected and they're very clear that that's a steppingstone.  But once you realized it that need for protection actually creates the attack or what called the attack because that's what opposing it.  I need to be protected.  The universe is all right willing to match that for you.  That's it.  Something says that when you realize that you are inherently protected you.  You don't need any sort of protection that you're safe as you are and nothing comes to you and when things do come to you if they are at a lower vibrational nature.  It's the same as if you are having an experience again at the 3-D level there.  If you have a being that is in of the highest frequency you have a choice to engage with them or to not engage the sentences you do hear their people you want to talk to people you don't want to talk to and it's learning to hold your band rate holder frequency of light and love to tell us a little bit more of actually moving into that frequency of light and love and holding that frequency outside allows some of us aren't even there yet.  Well, we all go into it and then you know we fall out of it.  This is kind of the natural pattern because once you heart centered and you start running higher vibrational energy anything like it starts to get triggered so it can come up to the process so that you can stay and maintain a high frequency so this is why a lot of times things really going really well and all the sudden I feel like we just dropped out will think what would happen.  I was thinking any negative thoughts that look like created so you know this is this is the typical Evan slow getting into your heart center is really really easy and it's as simple as taking something and the guides usually recommend thinking of an animal or place because people easily have subconscious thoughts about and even with animals.  If there are own animal it.  We may not be very happy with our dog because he just chewed on her shoes yesterday or are there maybe some others of conscious thought that if there is an image that you seen what you can contradict this really makes you smile like you notice is that you tend to feel lighter, you'll feel warmer.  Tingly uplifted and again you're not gonna stay there by what you start working with is remembering that you can go back there at any moment becoming conscious of the frequency that you're vibrating in this moment and is that frequency if it's a lower frequency you can choose a new hire residents by putting yourself back in your heart wow how does he get any better than will be easy that the mechanics of it are very simple and emotional beliefs and mental beliefs are when we get tripped up.  We think it got to be heart we think we have to spend 20 minutes meditating before we can connect our guide and you don't have to I have to do is get your heart center, and meditation serves its own purposes.  You are somebody who is really mentally active and have a hard time quieting your mind.  Meditation is really can help you but you don't have to meditate to get into your heart and her children to yourself there.  Think about something that makes you smile.  We all can go there guides do we usually have with us in our journey through I a lot more than we imagine of we have two angelic guides that are always with and my experience with a guide when they work with others.  There is usually one that was shot that represents himself as nail and another that was represent themselves as female, and this they did help us balance polarity for our belief in the masculine and the feminine.  Though there are two guys are always with and then we had other beings that we contracted with Aleve asked to check in on a scene everything in the earth, and I can remember anything so can you check in on me and so those things.  Periodically throughout our lives and ask other friends and family will show up for us as well so needed.  They say we had hundreds of themes that are constantly with and then as we ask for assistance and.  They are listening to another thousand deep that there are so many beings who are present and available to be of assistance to us that it would boggle our minds to really think about it, we can imagine having much support.  Also, what would it take for us to be totally open and and comfortable to receiving all of that support I hear so many people say that they are lonely and tired of doing it on their own and that seems like such a sadness when we've got hundreds of beings of light that are there willing and able to support will BACK to connection in the first place you connect is inside and getting Hart Senate and you connect with yourself and with the energy and when you start getting at Thessaly everything else, take care of itself.  Because when you strengthen that connection that your your core connection and most of us are looking for outside of ourselves in romantic relationships or what we want from family members or friends really seeking is our own connection with energy and that our sense of loneliness in a source that were seeking.  I also see this with a lot of people who start their spiritual journey and they feel like they don't belong here.  I'm not home.  Home is out there.  Home is on another planet and another system it's in another lifetime and really when you start opening out within what you discover is that your connectionless source that Solomon and his lifetime is in about going someplace else.  It's about opening up and bringing sensations here and you know once we start to open not internally then were open and available to deepen our relationship with everybody else around us.  We don't feel as insecure because were not trying to get things from other people.  We feel satisfied and hold within a cell right so how come so many of us find it difficult to open up to ourselves from within.  What's that all about what you have to operating system and in the game that were playing right now the 3-D game was designed to give us the illusion of separation and it was completely unique.  All the other dimensions we have an awareness that we are in individuated consciousness at that is also part of a collective energy and we thought how amazing would it be to incarnate and forget who we are how would that change the vibrational theory.  So as it came down through the dimensions as we descended, we had to have a way to remain in this dimension and is in the solution because the Remembering that we were designed for sanity.  So we pop out of the game and so we created the mind and that's where we run all of these programs lack and limitation and separation.  Then we also have the operating system apart here and finance faith.  We don't have all of the solutions we don't have that sense of separation when we put ourselves in a heart center we can access multidimensional information that then what will this will go back to the head and will try and pull it all apart through that limited filter that says these other things can exist.  I can't see multiple timelines.  I can then time I can't feel my full connections for sanity.  So we have this resistance because of these programs, we set up in the minds they keep us from sitting down and connecting I'm not good and I can't do that everybody else has the special abilities night I thought I don't have those.  I can't possibly do it, so we won't even try.  We get locked into that mental mindset that if you give it a shot.  If you can suspend that that belief that you're not capable of doing it for a couple minutes and simply put yourself in your heart center you do that a few times as well wait for this might be possible right and then it gets easier each time and you sustain it for longer and that deepens that fact that expands.  Now like everything earlier were not going to stay there and this is the process that were in right now is it's remembering to become more conscious throughout our day when we dropped out and gone into the old operating system of the mind.  They wait I have a choice, and you can alter your frequency again back to the heart and then you open back up to get his inspiration and divine guidance about what needs to be altered or assisted in order to maintain that sense of connection sense of multidimensional perspective.  So when we incarnated here.  We came from source energy.  Many religions seem to have actually viewed what that could potentially be could you share your awareness with us on what source energy actually is the one question I asked the guide to what their perspective on and simply say to me is the one thing we can't answer to put it easily and is also how I perceive it source is all that is in everything and innovate it is everything and nothing.  The space in between two my my understand my understanding in a week we fractured off from source energy and then we can only play in other rounds and dimensions of exploration to see what frequencies would be like how I think we know we often get caught up in this idea of hierarchy that somehow you know we have to incarnated the bottom and work our way back up to source any energy that were less than beings in other rounds and dimensions and you guys always remind me that you actually are source energy and those other aspects of yourself that are off having different lifetimes in different dimensions.  Further, also aspects of human aspects of source energy so it's not as if you got got it.  Earn your way out, you already are that seem easy to become think a lot of religions and a lot of our current beliefs about, me, they reinforce this idea that that we have to work in order to be deserving or work to be part of source energy and that definitely is in the case, and I can also be really quite damaging for some of us to just then we going to wrongness.  If were not adhering to those guidelines and rules absolutely lovely so you indicate that strengthening your connection.  I'll connection to our guides and the importance and value of grounding is something that we can consider in this call.  What would you like to suggest in regards to creating that for ourselves, one of whether you want to connect with your guides you want to connect more with your higher self course.  What he lacks is the records.  The process is the same.  It's all about frequency and learning to read frequency and again this is something that we all do every day is just becoming more aware and more conscious of what exactly does frequencies feel like if you walk into a room and typical of this had an argument and you have a sense that something's off feel very angry here with all had those kinds of experiences or somebody is upset or sadden and they don't say a word.  We didn't know because we conceal that frequency.  So when you start to channel.  It's just a matter of opening up to read frequency and for me that's how I define it.  It's bringing in frequency and putting into a recognizable form, though the source of the frequency can be our guides our higher self source energy Woody Kaushik record and then the recognizable form can be pretty much any creative artistic endeavor.  So whether it's speaking or drawing or painting your dancing or writing music.  This can all be forms of channeling and the first thing that you have to do in order to channel is to ground and connect the body and it may sound like kind of a simple thing but it's actually an issue that a lot of people are having difficulty with especially those who are highly empathic or highly sensitive because one of the ways that they coped in feeling like they could manage and not feel overwhelmed by all of the emotions on the planet heavier emotions.  They remove some of their energy from the body's look like a greeting yourself from your body and it numbs the senses so it worked for a while.  It allowed us to go but were getting to a point where it doesn't service any longer, and in fact it just Nexus feel fatigued.  It makes us feel disconnected and foggy, very foggy, though, in order to channel you have to be grounded to the body like and you know plugging at an appliance halfway into the wall outlet.  If you plug it in all the way.  You can't run the appliance and the same thing with your your own source bill energy and you people always ask how I know if I'm grounded or not.  If you are granted in your body.  You probably get a feel pretty forgetful.  I you walk into another room and you forgotten why you've gone and there is a pretty good indicator that you're not granted and connected to your body after walking around looking for your keys in there in your hands and you don't realize that there actually in your hand pretty good indicator that you're not in your body system is a lot easier to recognize what that granite ceiling is like by starting from a place of recognizing what it doesn't feel like running most people would describe it is feeling really vital feeling really solid feeling really energized very clear so if you find yourself foggy or disconnected then to take a moment and take a nice deep grass in a mansion is beautiful golden light coming into your body and it starts in one cell and the energy grows more and more intense until the cell can contain the brilliance of the gold line, and then it moves into the next cell workers brighter and brighter until the cell can no longer contain the brilliance of the light is on word until it was all the way through your body and that beautiful golden light is that's one of the visualization and you know when you're grounded and rooted and connected to the body.  It's also easier for you to recognize subtle frequencies things that you might miss if you are grounded and connected and present.  The grounding is the first thing in getting Hart and it is the second thing to do to connect to your kite so that the first thing that idea when I start any of my private sessions or do any of my own work or working with the group.  I feel this energy building up in my heart as I get heart centered and for me it's like this little star that goes supernova in my chest and it doesn't take a long time to get there and after 20 years.  It's almost instantaneous.  The moment I set the intention to do it happens, but it wasn't always that way for me and it took me just a little longer at the beginning and what your heart centered.  Then after question what is it that you want to now about the questions and formulate questions is really important because we forgot what I want to know about women curious about and what started you know my guys use my own personal life as kind the carrot to get me moving what you want to know more about because if you don't ask, you don't really get.  We have free will and they don't want to interfere with so that's in part why questions are so important because if you asked and they know that you're ready to give you everything on the topic can give you that you can handle.  And then once you get your answer it's trusting in yourself and using your discernment and this is probably the most difficult thing because we all want to write it off imagination want to say well that's probably wishful thinking it might be, but it doesn't mean that your wish is not accurate.  That might actually be the truth.  But the more aware you become of subtle frequency.  What you'll notice is that your imagination feels really flat in comparison to connecting with your guides connecting to the higher realms that information feels very full.  It feels multilayered and very robust where your imagination is an assailant in a one-dimensional feel pretty flat.  But that comes every time you start working and practicing my guys are pretty clear about taking the bits and pieces that resonate with you and leaving the rest behind.  And you know it's just a perspective it's just one perspective and it's the same thing as yakking a friend for a piece of advice do you want to do you want to take their advice or not at all can stand how do you feel about your projection.  This is your version of reality and you get to take Stetson and there is no right or wrong it's just having vibrational experiences and if you don't like going left then you can make a course correction and go right but you gotta start trusting in yourself and your end because the guides don't have answers that are any better than the one we have for ourselves and that that's hard for us because we feel like somehow are limited.  We don't have a full grasp of what's going on, but there is a part of us that we had access to that we got it's really beautiful.  Once we end up connecting with that part of ourselves we been working with frequency rather than form will always working with frequency and I would say in some ways the mind is what works well with form and that's actually one of the areas where people are struggling with a lot right now and.  Is we move forward is becoming more and more important for us to start working with frequency as opposed to the idea of what format frequency is supposed to take because everything you everything everything has its form so the guys in the example that you may ask for a particular set of frequencies and like a gift in a box that you can get the gift wrapped in 50 different packages and the packages can come come by on a conveyor belt.  But if you have your in your mind's eye.  The idea that your gift is going to come in a blue box with a big red bow on it and it just happens to be the 50th box you missed 49 potentials that actually have the frequency that you wanted inside you got so locked and attached to the form that you couldn't see it if you start opening up to just perceiving things from the level of form for the level of frequency.  It gets much easier to create and to receive hubris to receive and perceive your creations though to give you an example a lot of people get lost in what they want to do for work and you might have the idea that you want a job in marketing and so you have that form in your mind that if you start working with frequency.  It may be that you want a job that allows you to be created to be around people who are fun and have great humor.  You have a job that has some structure, but there's also a lot of creativity to it.  The workhours are pretty set the don't have to worry that you're working on the weekends or odd days and you want a job that involves a bit of travel you're working with the essence of the job that you might find that there are other areas that fit the bill.  It's not just marketing.  All the sudden a job in a completely different field says that but it has everything you want, has the vibrational essence and it was a big problem right now because right now a lot of people know that there is something new that they want just don't know what it looks like they have the sensation that they let their doing is working but they don't see in the current reality anything that's appealing and so they just feel stuck and they sat down and if you start working with the vibrational essence Anthony start creating some new remarkable forms because the guides again are pretty adamant about this that permitting into a time in which are creating new institutions for creating new forms that we don't have any physical reference point for right now there is nothing that exists in our current reality, it looks anything like what working to create so before looking around for something in terms of having a visual image of what it's gonna look like were not and that can be really frustrating.  So if you start working again with for with the frequency then that will keep you moving forward and there may be two or three different things that will fit that bill or will be stepping stone to creating that these are saying that you have to start somewhere.  Since starting with frequency is the only way to go you make it sound so easy.  I know that there's so many people that are struggling right now with all of these earth changes in energy frequencies that are coming into the planet you advise well enough painted perception though if you're struggling or having discomfort.  It's all about shifting your perspective and in looking at your programs, what belief systems.  The holding in place that are keeping you in the uncomfortable position, but enough I'm not lovable and unworthy and not deserving and we have so many variations on that theme, but if you can start looking at that and one of the exercises you can work with is now to work with the subconscious mind and negative thought to create this is still in the blank on whether that an upset relationship or whether that fatigue or physical illness.  It minus negative thoughts create this is the reason I created this is film of blank and then you know the thought.  I need to replace it with is in again film the blank your subconscious want you to now so if you can start the sentence in the first few times it may be difficult to it.  Maybe I don't know enough.  I knew I would be asking.  I don't know but eventually what will happen is something will pop out and it may not be logical.  It may really surprise you that it's something that you just never would've thought was related to the issue that you're having.  So it may be.  I'm not deserving right then you can turn that upside down and and it's I am deserving a ask yourself the thought.  I need to replace it with it.  I am deserving and then start feeling what that frequency is like in your body.  If I can imagine what feeling deserving with like this is what it would feel like and then just allow yourself to imagine it and to get that feeling running through the body all of the pad at some point the entire range of vibrational emotional expression so it's not that anything is foreign to us.  It's just it made the frequency that we haven't run for a while that we had access to it.  And if you're working for the mind.  The mind well I don't know how says what that process.  If you're in the heart center.  You know how to do it intuitively.  It's like breathing.  You don't think about you to do it, and it's the same thing when you're in the heart center, you automatically know how and this is something that takes a little getting used to, because you know was who socially conditioned to think it's all about taking action without follow a particular set of debt in particular set of rules.  If you get into the heart center and you open and just allow and receive then that's when you get the hits of inspiration about the steps that you can take that will propel you forward what new beliefs you can hold about yourself that the first Wendy Wendy looks like Ariadne dropped off structure shall be right back on but there with the sticker time for her to take the question if you're on the webcast.  You can submit your questions in the little Q&A and if you're on the phone, you can press start to raise your hand and on the webcast.  We had a couple coming in the lane from London said hello.  First I want to thank played in all the support given all the amazing learning that I've been receiving from them through Wendy and Nora on the question is about a possible lesson but I'm not quite sure I'm really reading it.  Well, I didn't have close family does for me when I was growing up and my children won't have either.  If it wasn't for my sister and some dear friends are part of our lives.  What is it for me to learn about it seems to be such a common thing to have most people, parents and grandparents to help and be there for us even if it's to just once while I understand this is not how it meant to be for me.  I'm not sure why I can tell you the first thing I'm hearing and I think, and the people probably address that will make it to channeling as well, but also it to be that family comes in many shapes and sizes, and as you start open to the idea of in your definition open up your definition of what family is you find that there will be a lot more people to be there to fill that role of family and you know family as we perceive it here in the 3-D realm is different than we beings of light tend to see it.  So what I'm also hearing for you is that you are aligning more with that version of your family to help anchor that that belief here in 3-D reality.  Yeah, I said, I think the keys to make it out of the way here.  I think the public and want to come back to that that more okay and I'm Ariadne's background, so I will let her take over so much we actually question coming in from a column so one moment please.  I think actually accidentally drop that call Shelley are the questions from the the webcast kicking back on okay great with us from Tennessee okay somebody please call had Ariadne while I will Wendy I was so excited to get to talk to you.  I had discovered you in my searching the Internet and I was just so surprised to find you are not surprised you think this workout find you on the show.  So am I been working on and I've been working on some walk with the inability to and I'd have a lot as well as psychic experiences all my life but I'm going to reconnect.  I wanted to ask you about something that happened to me the other day and meditation.  It was such a wonderful experience because I received I I've asked about her help with my problem and I received are the words frozen which I can tell you are being humorous with me and then I gave the image of the Egyptian hieroglyph image of you.  Note 3 stones feet and down and have a message out 1 foot in front of the other, but it continues because I I felt an affinity with things like maybe being part of that mystery school in a previous life and I was told yes I was and lag.  It's too long to to relay the whole thing was just a wondrous one just experience but they led me through the exercises with vision and kind of prompting me to use use my powers to open up a box with my mind and things like that and what one section of it.  I will say I went to open a box with my hand and I said you can.  You are very powerful.  You were a priestess.  It's embarrassing to me to say that this is just what I see you can do it.  Your mind and sure enough I did it with my mind and inside this box were to glowing eggs just by listening them to be in my hands.  They became in my and I could feel the warmth and they were going and the information I receive is that my block is that I've been out of the knowledge keeper that I've been so busy guarding college and during that the egg yes I was the only feeling a sense of the sacred and one of our entering experience in all the time I'm disintegrated into.in the dust to the molecule and the more that you don't need that in the garden that he everyone has the key.  The key is in the frequency and the need to go object anywhere.  The lot continued on to wonderful experience.  So just going to trust that felt like that was channeled information to me is so difficult.  If you want comments sure is a lovely vision.  Wow, stemming from a levels and layers to that and I think what you experience is pretty typical that people have these visions and in the moment they feel readily powerful to you and then you go back to the mind and you start pulling apart, counting it, and no, I couldn't possibly be that powerful.  I couldn't possibly be able to access information though it's learning to trust that because if you go back into the heart center and you remember what that feeling felt like in that moment.  In that moment you knew with absolute certainty that this was real, and then he went back to the mind to pull apart so it is once again checking in right, in which pieces of it are valid for me now because there may be something that you receive in a vision that was valid for you in a moment he received it, but it may no longer be valid.  You know, two months from now or two years from now, there may be new information fresh information for you that if you checking in to say is this resonating with me is my truth today and what is important for me to take away from this today will very quick question about another quick question is that I I had kind is not been researching any of the information probably home almost 20 years and was talking to me.  Once I started researching my father were the light work going light work for you and then when I started to read.  I could I've always had this intuition knowing I'm a visual artist I would help.  They told me they said the keys made after I was the math Masters and Bullis Blackwood, a visual artist if I had to laugh.  They like and felt it was interesting that I thought might want what you want it, and so on.  Nothing yet.  I read I'd go by knowing you know now how do you know that I just now I feel real affinity for that and that whole Starscream concept and would you say that if people feel that affinity that the main validation of that will delight yes I would like yeah that that sounded familiar to the yes this is a recognition and a frequency that somehow is vibrating with you.  This is true that there's something for you to pay attention we pay attention to with that and you know we all have those moments occur conference where we do simply know what something is and then again you answer simple to say in a piece of an art center that really from that faith.  That's when we experience that clear cognizance and it takes practice to stay there and if you have that awareness and trusted follow through with it because what you'll find is that when you take action based off of that that pensive knowing that that helps you to build up your trust in your discernment in what you're getting.  Because I'll get the reflection back that it was accurate so just keep working with Jackie taking steps with that we don't get it.  We all have the ability to tap into that sense of their cognizance and what you want to give someone a term of light worker starts the door interlock terms out there and we all have it in a sense we are all light workers.  There are some people who are displaying the darker role for now because we can't playing duality without both the light in the dark.  So some of those critical light workers have gone the dark role for right now and I think that actually is.  It is another thing.  When people start to really want to make somebody else the perpetrator we have to let go of that game.  We actually have to let go of it and see that they are also course energy and for this go around their playing that that part and they are in service to the rest of us because without that reflection, we can't see where we are necessarily playing it out in ourselves.  If we didn't have that program running in ourselves.  We would even know that they were there so that that's something else that I wanted to mention that I know this is an issue for people as they first start to awaken.  They want to they fall very easily into victimhood about all that was happening.  The conspiracies and manipulation and in all of this really heavy stuff and you feel like you can't change any of it, but it's all happening so that we can see collectively what we have collectively created you forget that you like to go now in effect with channeling the pleading.  I think maybe yeah so I will say one other thing before I get away with the keys they do work with tenant sound, which is why the dialect is different than my own.  People always ask and and it's not any one particular dialect.  It just sounds and sounds that resonate with you at a cellular level seat is to make sure is a very easy with yourself you are receiving the equivalent of an energetic healing I when you listen as well as receiving information.  I ideas this is the ninth dimensional to the 80 and collectively needed a pleasure and an honor to have the opportunity to connect with fuel filler donated by some of the choices that you all are making at this moment and grounding and connecting to the bloodiest when he was talking about is one of the things they are important as well as your ability to start working more and more with frequency as opposed to form what frequencies that you want in your life, joy, bliss, happiness, connection, patience abundance, as opposed to what those forms must look like and that gonna bring you a life of great i.e. you can find the able to create and manifest in unknown ways way that are beyond your imagination.  Things that Shylock that are of matching residents that you didn't know even existed.  So if you can implement some of those beliefs.  Some of those focuses then we think they had a much easier time but with a question so I area.  If you have questions of your own or someone else has a quick and weird with real to have an opportunity to take a question asked some a woman in Edmonton.  I am struggling with choosing where I should be working.  I work in financial services and also do body healing work.  There are so many things I'd like to do.  I have also done channeling.  However, I have not channeled for a couple of years so wondering where I should be working any awareness so you know not be too repetitive, but again what the essence of what what you find appealing in your industry.  If you've chosen initially in the past, there is something that was fun about it.  Most of you occasionally for some of you find that you did.  It is a life that you just didn't get a paycheck because that you needed and that was all that was available that you can you can create more bliss, more joy in your life.  What qualities do you want a job do you want something that is structured or something that is actually freeform.  Do you want to work with a small group of people or large group of people and for you that you cannot you need a medium group arrives there for the person asking the question because the you to be by yourself.  You can be to cut off you need more stimulus than that and too many people will be overwhelming.  So we would say not more than four families you work with on a very regular basis.  At the core of people.  If you want to work is a healer.  It still means the same thing that you may have people who come in and out but didn't know the core of people that you deal with with your business be that in people that you rent space from or that you go to to bounce ideas off you have a regular support system that consists of 45 people.  Also, when it comes to work out what kind of things do you want to do what you somebody who likes to problem solve all you somebody who like to come up with new ideas.  I use somebody who, like numbers and figures and seeing how they all add up in hell and and having balance you know what things are interesting to you and your childhood if you really lost go there.  What else did you like to play with dolls.  If so, how did you don't like you know DDR did you like to play designer with your goals always you dole a therapist that they like to help people work through their problems.  You know, did you like to go outside and play games you like to be really physical you reading okay childhood, and what kinds of games you like to play and what was it about your game.  It was so thick so start pull apart and reading.  Look at the qualities that you like with the job.  Then on a regular basis and imagine yourself and you experiencing the qualities that you get to get up out of bed and have this vibrational experiences you get to work with 45 we decreed fabulous people that you get to be created that you get to have a really flexible schedule right you get to be supportive of other people you get to help people problems felt whatever it is that you'd like to do and it's doing it in the moment we always say thoughts create form in a sense, but emotions vibrated into being what we mean by that is that your thoughts create the wavelength, the form wavelength the frequency, wavelength, right, not necessarily the picture as it shows up, but the actual wavelength and then your emotions.  The emotions underneath it.  We create the amplitude.  How how loud and how strong that pulls out to the river.  If you're really happy we are really upset if you're extremes of an it's much louder than if you're kind of apathetic in the middle so your emotions will drive into things in the why the emotional component is so important in your creative process and then they open is about moving between the feminine and human energy arrived.  So as you said and you get quiet about things that you want to create you in the feminine state in any pulls out the frequency to say this is what I want the energy to that that the masculine and then you go back into the Senate and receptive state to be open to see what's in front of you and anything are frequently for that resonating with enough interesting and many take me back to the masculine energy for me to greet it when it shows up when it's reflected back to you and how the creative process worked.  It's vacillating between the feminine and masculine energy.  The old way of doing things was what we will call the lower masculine energy.  It was a particular pattern a particular structure that you assess the fallout and you will get very shut down.  It's very difficult to create from that level because you missed so many opportunity.  If you can work from the Hyatt design masculine level of following the bread crumbs is the show to you saying who it is.  This was the frequency I wanted and I took a step towards it and now I'm getting a back again and put out what I want to see what shows up in the to take another step that you following the divine breadcrumbs if you will and what is that you get to your results if you will much faster than if you followed the old lower masculine set and usually means that there is less trauma.  There's less resistance in ease and flow and usually the form that it comes in is easier than what you might have experience doing it.  The old low a masculine way that would be our first suggestion shall we move on to another question course we've got one coming in from Toronto.  Can you please give us an update on changes in the financial system that you have predicted for February 2014 I guess would be down March 2014, will you you actually decided it would mean so much of the drama you paying more attention to the year-end creative power.  So were really happy to see that we still think as you move into mid-late March, that money is going to be on people's minds.  It is more information coming out about some of the financial institution there had been some tests shall we say about making some adjustments to different currencies rather well.  You seen some fluctuations going on in the currencies in different parts of the world that is Indonesia.  When you looked back over the last month.  It was in days with the currency reading was the testing ground to see what would happen so you know, there is still potential of to have some shakeups, but what we think will happen is you you move through mid-March late March.  They may be more bits and pieces of information coming at about some of your institutions and some of them but will say less and higher behavior right less and then a higher frequency behavior.  Some of the control that's been going on more that information will start to surface that we don't see the need for you to create any sort of major collapse enough of your awakening and reasserting your power energetically that you don't need that is your reflection.  Well that's beautiful.  How does it get any better than that will hopefully it's a lot easier in August is another kind August is another time where you know you to be asked to make some adjustments.  Actually, you can move out of your need for currency is not there.  You not even close to being there right now and why we tell you tell you this because you are still working in a conditional system even if you went to system a barter it.  I'll give you this for that and the new system that you're about to build is unconditional.  It is service based in that you provide service and you know whatever you need will be provided for you don't have to worry about getting it back from the person that you are giving and you are not energetically enough, they collectively or individually.  Like the name you when you look around the financial institution you get very upset when you shut down around money.  It's very neutral, if not right.  It's not wrong.  You are still living in a material world so we would caution you about your desire to push it away right allow it to be.  It's a tool and if the tool you are using right now and from any of you who are spiritual."  Past there is a reduction of that institution and what you find that reading about being on a spiritual path is the acceptance of all things.  They you can't push that away eats requiring you to make peace with it, and to know that it can have value.  It doesn't define who you are.  You are a divine being of light but it is a tool and it is one way that you express your energy beautiful.  Another question we got from London.  Deepest gratitude to Wendy for her service.  She has saved my life and sanity so many times a question for the piece what's wrong with pressing the snooze button it's a toy but we will say that the longer you wait the more rust you can be in a sense, if you really think about how it feels in the morning if you get up plenty of time to get ready you can have your coffee, you can have a nice breakfast.  You know you can read the paper.  You can maybe check your emails ready to go out the door so that field to you, as opposed to getting asleep and then having to jump out of it.  Three.  Close on the door.  They both pleaded to think like a right you still headed out the door thought you just what you wanted and that is no right did no wrong in what you get to to really work with him.  There was a well there were two questions earlier.  We also want to answer and for many of you there is a great fear about making the wrong choice right to anyone news you want to get up you have the ability to make a choice and then make a course correction.  The fastest way to shut down energetic flow is to remain in your decision.  So if you are unable to decide what to do.  We say simply make a choice right.  So take a step in the direction because once you step energy thoughts to flow and then he thought the game is aware that all this works for me.  00.  This isn't quite what I want, so I'm going to make a course correction to choose something else.  So we highly encourage you if you feeling shut down and indecisive, just move in and we were listening earlier to the story about having presence but just make the choice.  Just take a step you can always change your mind you all get locked into the this idea also that you can't you can't change because if you change your wishy-washy you can go back on something that we would say all of you a growing and developing.  So the idea of the theories.  The opinions that you had two weeks ago may no longer be valid because you may have grown and expanded, and of the ideas or opinions that you have may not change a lot, but the time someone because you've changed your perspective changed and in the change may be minuscule but there is still a change.  See you all ever evolving and growing in second thing that you know we were listening in, and the question of that family and an expanding the definition of what family is really understanding of connection to everyone and everything that the special relationship don't just happen with the person that you give the label to of mom or dad there just a representative of source energy here.  See you there just to take it down into the perception of masculine and feminine or the masculine aspects of gold of the feminine aspect of God.  So they had a representative for you but you know, even if they are not in your day-to-day life.  You still have opinions about them even if you will, given up for adoption at birth.  You still have about them.  They set you off your programs and beliefs, but your family and who you: the finest family is actually a choice not to your expanding all of you.  Your awareness is that your connection to allow everyone to the level of connection we put a question from a column question from someone on the phone from Denver, Colorado.  Please go had not very clearly.  Can you speak a little louder please guess is that better.  Yes, it is highly I feel like this kind of goes along with the career question.  You entered earlier, but I feel like I've been really doing my best to just follow frequency to be open to different opportunities talk to different people try things, but I've gotten really frustrated because I feel like nothing moving.  I felt stuck and then I get frustrated and beer comes up and on what you hear.  I've been for me right now it's a big fear of just supporting myself of financial security.  So the kind of safety and security fears and so with that I really this last week tried to not deny it but to honor and recognize the fear and then to to move into my heart center to hold a piece both around it but I just so I shifted that some butter this following frequency in the breadcrumbs.  I just feel like nothing's really opening up and so then I kinda question my doing it wrong what what it out.  What is you know why are things not not moving.  Why haven't things opened up for me even like over the last two years or so I could been doing this for two years and I haven't really settled on anything, and hopefully this also helps other people who might be selling stock as well.  All right.  So what is shelling out feel like when you fold the bread crumb what does show up because showed up.  Otherwise, you would be attracted to the watch shows up anything to choose one example I will have an opportunity to connect and do something with someone in a and I know the ideas to do it and not worry about the financial gain peace, but there's also that important piece that I can find something that isn't going to give me financial gain in six months, but is going to give me some kind of compensation for my services now light so I had a feeling that being compensated well.  One of the interesting things that I just got in sitting with my fear, maybe just getting it in a different way, but I realized that being in a position thinking about this whole victim piece in that part of receiving is a part of.  If you receive from people you're in that victim or needy place and I'm not so much from value in the workplace, but just in general that I want to allow myself to receive from somebody you know in our the way things work.  It's usually you know what successful at somebody's paying the bill for something and if you're receiving your the needy, helpless, one felt that was huge for me to see that part of victim and so I'm trying to move into a place of how can I allow myself to receive but from a place of balance and not victim or your answer goal euro question for you.  So I arrived to your obviously on the right track to get you really are.  So sometimes you just need many reflections in order to release the and in every encounter that you have there is something that you're receiving the right.  Sometimes it's a reflection of of the lowest forms and we can see them then you can change them because they don't know that they're very hot.  It was in trouble.  So even if something didn't quite work out the way that you wanted to it was something of value in it for you.  So we would say all the focus on the value of what you going out of it because sometimes what you get in what you quote what you what you think you want really what you need to get you weight you are asking to go so that's that's one thing and then focusing on what you are receiving will help you to receive more all right because that will open the gate.  You can knowledge receipt of something away.  I can receive identity.  I just acknowledged where I got it now.  We would also offer you another perspective of receiving that can help you if you are one who has a very hard time opening up to receive the to live in balance.  If you're constantly getting out any not receiving even in the energetically depleted and many of you who are healers.  Many of you who are working in the in the the spiritual realm.  If you will have a very very difficult time receiving and you find that your life is out of balance because you are constantly trying to get to.  We would say also look at the programming around the need to give it up for approval right and you found it on the negative end of it, that you're not good enough you you're the victim if you allow yourself to receive so that the PCM the other perception.  We would offer to you is that if everybody's giving and nobody's receiving then that is it really serving anybody and you know how good you feel when you are able to be of service to somebody else.  Yet you had that experience.  Yes, yes.  So when you are able to receive then you allow something else to have that feeling when you don't allow that energy to come in they feel they can feel supported.  They can feel old.  I must not of been good enough they didn't want me it's that that can set up that kind of programming.  If you think about Hatfield on your end when you try to offer something and somebody doesn't want it when it's denied even if it's a customer so he will do that until you look nice today.  Oh yes, thought feel very good if you're the one giving the compliment.  It makes you going to contractions with a 910, unless your summer is really good holding a frequency so just think about that that you will be able to receive is allowing somebody else to be of service and that will empower you as opposed to putting them in the vacant position.  You had a little when you think about resetting somebody to be of service that feels good right and the work that you do a tremendous amount and variety of supporting someone else's dream when you're working.  Whether that's the dream of something that gets created in the corporate world.  Whether that's a dream of of balanced health right so it's honoring urine value that will support you the rehab that helped you you you were talking about financial system earlier with our current financial system in the way were set up and want to be open to receiving in ways other than tied to to my work, but with the system.  We've set up in the exchange for services for money.  It feels like that's still the main way that we are going to bring in in buying financial income ways to support ourselves obviously.  Sometimes there are other options, but I mean is that true or is that still disbelief system and we just weekend should shift that now the moment know where to find them over the moment that we are at all right say don't deny it.  Don't hate it, don't push it away just acknowledged that, and when you do, then the other way start to show up as other forms can come in because the fees you've got an aversion to money that's what's going to be your reflection that can be the first thing to show up as your aversion right to some extent thing.  There have judge and that's gonna be your reflection as opposed to your ability to allow things to come and be received in a higher way though, so best to focus on really being in a place to be open to receiving and acknowledging my value also and and again just trusting a letter today.  This is where we are today.  We had a monetary system.  The majority of you get the majority of your your money through your job how you define a job for most of you is that it's arduous it there are a couple things you like about it, but for the most part you prefer to do nothing and the other piece if you'll have you take money off the table and you don't have to work most of you are at a loss.  You don't know what to do with yourself.  If you have absolute creativity and your creating your reality absolutely you had a very hard time standing in your power you haven't managed to do it yet.  This is what you working through so you know in some ways system is serving you until you can stand in your full power to say this is what I want to create.  I realize I don't have to do with money into my survival.  My well-being who I am.  None of that is defined by my money my abundance.  That's just something that I can create if I want.  But it doesn't define who I am and you're quite that part at that stage yet so Makepeace is way you are and then today where you want to be what you want to create.  Had he want to interact with people and there may be some new projects that you take on the that don't involve money but yet allow you abundance to come in other ways because you're opening up your stepping into more of your power by taking action in that activity.  It all of a sudden.  You know, there may be other energy that comes to you whether it may be material goods or are at the needy services that you wanting that normally you exchange money for that show up and acknowledging them when they do show up to a look.  I didn't have to have money that the services this abundance was provided in unknown ways a unique way knowledge in the places where it does exist in a life right now is had a change that system in a sense, yes, thank you.  You will have another question from Holland.  We have autism in the family.  Why would anyone incarnate with this affliction will be run lots of levels to this epidemic that your scene with children in particular who are coming in with autism.  It serves the collective consciousness because again you have to understand whether somebody comes in with a disability or they come in with challenges in the family structure or you know whether they come in with any issue, it doesn't really defined in the art.  The role that the plan because you are a divine being a flight.  So from that level.  That perfect visa will want to take on these issues and see what the vibration is line and is also a level of service of for the souls that achieving autism because they are showing you they are coming in connected to the five degraded that coming in connected to a different collective reality than the adults of this planet because the adults were plugged into the 3-D collective consciousness and the children are not there plugged into the 5D is in part why the rating of the Internet.  They really them there.  They're very very sensitive and this is in part why they were drawn into themselves because it was his when he was talking earlier when you remove your soul listens from your body is your half patio body on it.  That is your way of coping with your sensitivity and the children are doing the very same thing going inside the going very deeply inside.  After as a way of coping with that highly highly sensitive physical body that they are creating for himself because of this connection to the find the correct account that are helping you to see some of that and and I really really focusing you on at not being judgmental.  There really focusing your acceptance of another being exactly as they are nothing that needs to be fixed or changed about them.  And when you accept them as they are that's in a really calm and that's when they ate will open up to you.  Now the novel level that they are helping you will work with is seeing the toxicity of your environment.  What you all have created as your reality because the toxins in your environment by helping you to create this is the physical, mental,.  There are many things you doing the running balance creating physical imbalances and more that is becoming aware to you as you are looking at all the genetic modifications and pesticides and herbicides that are being spread on food supply, and you're also looking at what is chemically being sprayed in the air so is it helping to draw your attention to just why so many of you are and when you start to once again take responsibility for your co-creating that you can step into your power and you change things very rapidly on the planet.  The change in the balance and in nurse health.  It's not to take hundreds of years.  When you all learn to step into your power and start to run energy as a divine creative being what will happen is that you heal yourself and the earth is a reflection of you and so she then also it will heal very very quickly.  It's not to take a long time, but it does require you to step up and start taking responsibility on a long-winded answer for the question.  Thank you.  We got another call in one moment please.  Okay William White from Texas.  Please go ahead and estimate it.  See you there and I'm here, this is Kathy White from Midland, Texas beautiful Kathy okay thanks so much for taking my call so excited to do this with you today question isn't what would the Pleiades have any insights concerning.  I have a really strong desire to take what I've learned through access consciousness into our national political system.  I actually ran for mayor of Miami, home of my town and I didn't win and Alana came out of all that got some I'm just excited to talk to you about anyway am been regrouping from that campaign situation and I just am empathic and I just like I know we all are, we can into it and that's what I want to see leading him to transpire from that level in our country so I wonder what you might know about that we already starting to arrive I buy you working on yourself you are injecting that energy into all your activity and even you walk in the street without even helping your mouth you are spreading their frequency and honest have the ability to tap into in her life.  You will get the other lots of different methods so you know you found one.  The residence with you in it.  That's wonderful.  So you know it.  There are lots of ways.  He together and it may be that you want to start working the political level, and working with that.  That's great.  There are many who are are there with you that you are starting to see more people working with their spiritual base in in not in the old-fashioned religious way that in more of a we want to be of service and inclusive of everyone you mean and help to shift the perspective of reality that that is starting to make its way into those who are running for office.  I am on the run of something there and I definitely how do we how do I get better received job become electable to where I can inspire further automatic speaking from your heart moronic that that you just keep doing what you you do, others will awaken when they're ready and you never to be able to control that.  But what you can do is just keep speaking your truth and keep working in in the way that interesting to you that your excited about your passionate about and things will unfold from there.  So just keep keep that if you feel that that's a job that you want and keep going for it and if you know people already that total that there are people who are ready, perhaps in another area and that area was not sure what few writers, people will start to show up for you and it may be, they years.  Not everybody was ready this go-round, but there are people around you who are curious and that you will you will spread the message with all of you, and that that core of you you know it exponential in its expansion as those people start talking about wanting change and said you know the idea of your political system is one of the areas that was saying that they know you're going to create new institutions that you don't have any idea what the form looks like with things It you know you still even what you still want to have some government debt when not taking personal responsibility will be doing is asking somebody to be an authority of the so when you start taking on personal responsibility and and you start accessing the high levels of consciousness where you understand that you are in in the and individuated consciousness as well as the collectives that you feel in that moment what each toys feels like an individual level, and then what ramifications that has of the collective level and whether you want to pursue it, and I know you no longer have a need to be governed because you already understand what can happen.  So some of your political structure will change.  You won't need all the rules and regulations that you can I have some of that will go by the wayside.  But you've got to start working with the frequent state which he dealing and then the form will transform the frequency you keep what you doing your old aunt had absolutely anything to you on the one speaking see where else you can get involved without a people who the Hastert theme is an interesting week we dictated in a negative way.  The vet then opus.  Perhaps prestige through the language that they use to be quite as far out there.  I don't mean that they're working in operating in any different way than you are.  It still section the language that they are able to use this is is an easier bridge for some to cross that out working with those people and supporting those people, but another question.  Can you tell me if one is ever too old to develop spiritually diluting because you it absolutely aid it real and you are a spiritual being at the core course is dropping the limited believe that we will say, for those of you who been on the planet longer you been in the old system longer so sometimes it can feel a bit more challenging to let go of some of those old belief systems that you can do it absolutely and and beautiful thing.  It would be like telling yourself well.  I reach a certain age and I'm in on say 60 and I can't learn anything that's basically akin to what what you saying that you ever evolving ever-changing is to simply opening up to what already exists inside of you and dropping the illusions of limitation, lack of separation.  One more question.  We have had two older sons with schizophrenia and work a lot with entities should I develop my abilities with entities.  How about channeling will the basically the same thing.  You know when you're working with entities away you are working with what you would call high dimensional of the film the angelic's and eat you basically rating frequency and when we look at schizophrenia.  A lot of that is just on integrated energy I said that there is the identification with another aspect of self and sometimes it can be in a lifetime.  Sometimes it can be a personality aspect that is you know you can certainly get more information and understanding of that effect year your curiosity and in what you want guidance from from you gates and and you know we work with you all the time where you asked for it, consciously or not, was still working at the subconscious level with you women giving you messages and information you need your body at night and we have conversations and you meet with other celestial frames and and pain would give you information and instant feedback when you opinions about what you might try what you want to do.  If you feel called to do that we would support you with that in not starting in the expanding with authority were getting close to the end of the call.  Is there anything that you would like to offer all of the listeners.  In general will again you'll have the ability to connect with your guy.  We are always here and you need it need Wendy we have to do again is put yourself in your heart center.  Listen, you should assignment the teachers that resonate and entrust all right so if you're in doubt about what something means you might say you know a piece we think that you are trying to tell me that this is this is the choice of me and and can you give me some confirmation rights and will do our best to put it in your physical well you get it.  He no longer wanted to just ask that physical comp confirmation goes through your mind.  You confirmation.  It is a sign from my guide and take it as such.  Otherwise, that thought would not even cross your mind though try to trust it and what will happen if you get the confirmation which makes it then easier for you to come back to connect with you guys can use it well in her life.  I got it right in and fill the fears will get in the way and in the same way it makes it easier than to try and hear your assignment and yes you know you have your own programs and filters and sometimes says do cloudy information, but when you get better reading frequency.  You'll notice when you're clouding the information we would also say to you that you know it's not easy if you get information on a topic that you are not emotionally invested in so you can also play around with asking questions that you are heavily invested in and asked for confirmation and that will help you to gain trust so that when it comes to something that you feel holds a bit more weight like what should I do with my life or what I do about my financial security and then it makes it easy to you already established what we will call baseline so feel free to call us at any time you want.  We always around watching, waiting and setting many well we should so if we can deepen it was so amazing P's.
