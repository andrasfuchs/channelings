Good evening.  So tonight's topic is attracted amazing life majority have and instant versus gradual manifestation of this remind everyone that I have I've categorized while teaching under three teaching category and artist very briefly go through the eye.  Don't know why exactly I just feel like giving you the context of the so be in my Academy.  For example, I teach two ways so there's the way to fill realization in the way self-actualization and I understood.  There is some confusion for some people about that.  So the way socialization contains my first two teaching switches.  I call them enlightenment and infinity and the way of self-actualization contact with her teaching which are: parliament, which is what I'll talk about today in an line is in line with that, the manifestation ideas the principle that you are constantly communicating with your creation, and that this is indeed your creation that this is indeed your chosen world and how to become more conscious about and how to be able to more conscious harmonious interact with yourself about what my first teaching enlightenment is all about and you can follow me as I speak relaxing into that which is already here.  What is that which is already here.  If you it, I thought I'd with it as I am aware that I exist.  Who here does not exist.  Can you measure who here is not aware, the biggest measure through my you just completed my first teaching very well me two years to get this one down and I'm pretty facile with my second teaching.  There's some subtleties to that teaching, but this is just a very brief synopsis and in the Academy and somewhere on Facebook for this was a while back you can find this diagram on a call of the self-realization index the map of the revision and it shows you the way to fill realization.  It shows you all these different stages from the I am person, but since I am a person one step back would be.  I am without the addition of the person and then even the birth recognition that the eye is that awareness which is aware of the sense of them.  The sense of being so roughly in my consists of these to the stew super subtle beautiful eternal aspects of your being, which is awareness and present are being so in the IM, there is the eye or were not being aware of the fact that there isn't business of a certain kind of through the present.  The presence of the M the eye is the awareness by the awareness the eye.  If you are so we learn to relax into the recognition that we always exist no matter what happens to matter what changes the Thompson goes nothing has being as of its own.  It's all given being this by the IM that always here always know always already what we are.  It's always already our direct experience.  You can't change being aware of are you there is no other way to be aware of any experience with through the IM and then we rest in a sense even deeper.  We relax even more and we recognize that there is the subtle super spacious infinite aspect of our being, which is aware of.  I it's aware of the beam.  This aspect is aware of the presence right now you're aware of the presence that's shaping itself in the form of my voice in your body.  The sensation of sitting in your chair.  All of these sensations are all generated out of the being of the present energy aspect of creation, but there is an awareness of all then the second teaching is called infinity in which I share that it's although this is not relevant for everyone because it's not exciting to everyone but it is possible for you to realize that beyond awareness.  There is the infinite there is sort there is the one there is the absolute awareness itself has gone on the awareness itself has some kind of presence to it.  It still has business there is awareness be its emptiness, being first is presence being I am is presently awareness is emptiness suspicious being, but it still has some kind of a being is some kind of a presence to the mixer, there still is aware that you can say awareness if there is an is this is recognizable.  You can notice that you are aware, which means that awareness is actually not infinite.  It's still finite.  It is infinite in its scope, perhaps, but it's not infinite, and the fact that it cannot cease to be a self awareness cannot stop to be aware and since it has limitation just like your skin or your body cannot stop being body awareness cannot stop being aware so it is a creation even awareness of the creation so this creation creation, but it is the first expression of the incident of the one is the means through which you can know itself visits.  It is, it's free will with free agency.  The is the infinite importance important form in certain actionable form.  It has a workable form to in the state of awareness, but we can realize that as we rest is awareness,, and there is a sense of spacious free consciousness, we can ask ourselves what was here before awareness occur.  What existed before the came about awareness what is there beyond awareness.  What would there be without any aware what and if the sinks in for you.  This drops and if it happens to be relevant for you that it is like resting, resting is awareness or resting in the sense of consciousness is like becoming a sphere that contains the whole universe.  The principle that spacious free principle within which all appears is like you become aware of yourself as the very boundary of the universe itself.  The sphere that holds it all together as an experience within you ask yourself what is beyond even the experience or of experience what would happen if the bubble pop and if it's relevant for you and it hits home is like you're being sucked into a vacuum of sort you rate realize suddenly that nothing ever actually happened to do as the apps no awareness nor experience.  Nothing ever occurred essences instant healing is in some cleansing of all experiences you've ever had because you realize that on this absolute level of myself.  Nothing ever happened and when you restart realize that and bring it into your experiences while you're experiencing all kinds of or thinks you can start and more and more bring in an awareness of what's beyond awareness or an awareness of infinity or an awareness of absolute untouchability or an awareness of nothing ever happened to me is the absolute.  You can certainly more and more bring that since that understanding that knowingness with you into everyday experience and then you have that beautiful simultaneity of experiencing thing feeling things, perceiving things working on yourself.  Things not working on yourself.  Things resting is awareness things being hurt viewing pleasure, feeling joy while simultaneously famously having awareness that there is that ultimate aspect of your be which has no knowledge whatsoever of what's happening.  It's oblivious to.  It's completely oblivious to what's happening right is very peaceful to have that understanding with you wash it hits the so it gives you a great sense of in distractibility of infinity of timelessness and awareness can do this too presents under the stew they all have their different degrees and variations in shades of immortality, but this is the one that existed before life began some that senses the most time.  That's my second teaching called infinity for teaching us: Putterman which falls in the Academy falls under the way of self actualization.  Is a when we have realized know that you have to go through this.  First, you don't have to.  But let's say that you go through it.  As I went through it step-by-step.  In essence, laid out in the county you will realize through this freedom through this infinity through his immortality.  Having that stability of being nervous and even the beyond this aspect realized.  Having that at the core of your understanding of yourself, then somebody was left to do but enjoy yours but create but empower but share share benefit is the only thing that remains is to naturally overflow the naturally empower yourself and through that example to be a beacon for our other portions of yourself to recognize that Jews however they wish to respond to that whatever they want take from that project from that but the more you shine the more you help other portions of yourself.  The rest of yourself reflect upon themselves and make choices and get to know themselves a little better.  The company realized the true simultaneity of all these levels of existence of the fact that it goes all the way from nothing ever happened down to the nitty-gritty we are in a relationship.  I don't feel good right now because your hair looks which it all the way down to that level.  There is the true some of the Navy and everything in between.  There happening microphone give me a haircut this this is not based on your own.  So that's just a beautiful like this.  This is far as I have I keep developing myself just to go back to keep always expanding and developing and empowering all these different levels of my being both in the way of self-realization, as well as in the way of self-actualization.  But there is sort of an station which is not even the apps I used to think that the absolute is the end station and in a way it is because it's very final, but the installation so far has been what I call true simultaneity is the most critical enough to really speak and levels are anything but sometimes people ask me what's the most advanced realization that you know if you have to define that such a way and I would have to say is that of true simultaneity.  In other words, it's neither this nor that there is no one answer, it's the true simultaneity of everything that's premature where it ends in the sense that spree much.  There's nothing we are true simultaneity in that way because true simultaneity by three nature includes everything simultaneously and everything is equally validated as being an equally valid portion of creation or non-creation.  So is a very complete center to rest and to be in to be realized, that makes it so fitting three is that of empower consciousness or empowerment, and in this teaching the ways of actualization.  It's all about empowering yourself what does it mean to empower yourself.  It quite literally means to remember what is true about creation and what is not true recreation.  Forget what's not true.  And remember what is true so that you start to live as you are actually created as the image being created in the image of God is a quite literal statement US and I am individuation of the all that is consciousness that is the expression of the infinite, US, and individuated.  I am portion of that overall consciousness of that over creation has been created have been created in the image of God the image of the incident in the image of awareness.  The image of the one and you are endowed with infinite intelligence with infinite power with infinite inseparability with infinite connection to all the rest of yourself, which is infinite, which is an so empowerment simply is is very closely aligned to the way self-realization is just in a different direction.  It's it's it's a word little different, but in self-actualization what you're actually doing is through through contrast and through contact with your direct experience with your own creation through contacting that through being in the direct observation of this is my creation.  This is my experience and what am I learning from this you are practicing what it's like to be in individuation of the I am consciously consciousness in a conscious way more and more as you practice what it's like to be a conscious individuation of the all that is consciousness.  You will start to meet certain challenges you will start to face certain ideas and you will start to unravel more and more of both your individual as well as the collective unconscious mind that you have agreed to be a part of and that you have given your power away to and so empowerment means to more and more consciously meet your direct experience your own creation is that's what this is you have created this because there's no one else so that's all that this is your creation is so through meeting that through making contact.  That's how we learn like I was a baby learn to walk it bumps its towing to Iraq and it falls over.  It makes contact.  It treats friction.  It is through friction is through the meeting of consciousness with this generated creation with its experiences that it is that it meets the reflection of its own choices of its own vibratory state of being so that I can get to learn itself.  This constant friction how to make fire how do you generate fire and brilliance through rubbing to stone together friction contact so empowerment is gained through contact and we all have constant contact with our direct experience.  We can't escape it.  You cannot not experience this moment even on the absolute level you're not expecting, but simultaneously you're in you can see that you're not so it is through this contacting of your experience all the time especially when you start doing it consciously attentively with care with desire with intention with the desire to learn with the desire to expand with the desire to create in greater alignment with your true self to be of greater benefit to yourself and the rest of so through this contactor.  This contrast we learn to reflect upon ourselves, we start to feel ourselves research experience or self we start to gain greater consciousness we gain greater consciousness of who we are and how creation works.  And so we empower ourselves, or we disempower herself because friction since it is challenging by nature, since it faces us.  We are done for still a concern unconscious aspects being brought into consciousness and this is what happens all the time.  This is what meeting your direct experience is it's literally seeing a portion of your unconscious is made manifest so that it becomes conscious now many of us flee from this run away from this even become spiritual and restless awareness away from that's not a power unless you don't use it in that way unless it's not motivated by fear for pain and fear for experience in fear for fear so now that you know your immortal eternal suddenly consciousness opens up to meet experience and accelerated learning process and its self-expression process.  So now what is been infused the theme that has been infused into this show is a lifetime starts to accelerate user to learn the lessons more rapidly.  You start to embody an extent more rapidly.  This is what I call acceleration general as many facets of this but in general solution means that you are learning and reflecting more and more consciously the more conscious you are of each moment, the more benefit your extracting from your own creation of the unconscious be made manifest so that it can become conscious to make them normally I get more response does it not make sense does it not make a guest looking for was it shut.  I repeated, summarize it and slow down the no that's good I'm sure that this will benefit so you see this right.  This is your experience in your meeting at right now.  Can you say that you're not so you meeting this experience.  You can't escape your own creation every single non-second you're re-creating your creation a certain way the teachers something to show you something manifestation can also simply be called reflection or on the showroom of your unconscious mind.  This is your unconscious mind made manifest all the time the mix so you're always interacting with you on consciousness for this very physical role tangible level of your consciousness, which we call physical manifestation.  It's an immediate reflection of who you are.  It's a mere it's showing you your own face it, showing you more of your whole being, but it's showing you in a way that is conscious to on you know before she can deny it, and you can avoid it and you cannot be as conscious of it so that it remains in the realm of the unconscious, but practically speaking, if you pay attention to this moment, this floor is consciously your conscious of the floor.  Your conscious of my words.  This means that you are communicating with your syllabus speak.  You are right now.  Communicating with yourself, your unconscious which is really your superconscious simply unconscious to you but it's not unconscious in its own self.  It's superconscious and it's also the unconscious is about your consciousness the lawyer to the gray unconscious which is superconscious and sees way more the same time, the new do you only take things apart consciously, which is part of your famous human being, but the way they this greater self communicates to you is through one way it does so is through physical map station.  This is how it makes itself visible to the mix of so through your learning experiences through your relationships through your businesses through your job through your career through your anything anything that's part of our everyday situational physical relational life we communicate.  We were we see we perceive our unconsciousness indivisible for so that we can start to become more conscious of who we are as a vibrational of conscience everything is a reflection of your laboratory state repertory state for most of us is a largely unconscious, the majority of it is unbeknownst to ourselves so empowerment again is to become more conscious of what were sending out all the time and one way to do that is to start to learn from your physical manifestation because it's your unconscious vibration made visible to communicate knocking on your door.  Hello, this is what you look like on the inside, the maker so the physical manifestation is the unconscious mind made conscious or ideally you pay attention if you want to but is made visible, at least so this is how you meet yourself all the time.  There is no physical reality, not really you're just meeting with yourself without them except so this is a constant stream of communication is a two-way communication between 1B is a paradox, but it's a two-way communication within one being within one individuation of the one being.  We could say it's your lower self herself communicate.  If you want to call it that just for the sake of clarity, but all the time you're communicating with yourself, your learning from yourself was the theme of this talk it, I think you attract an amazing life instance was gradual image sensor that showed that just now because it helps you understand the balance of instant versus gradual map station.  Some of you may be here purely and solely because you want to accelerate the creation process of your life.  The changing process of your life you want to attract an amazing life which is great.  I applaud you for that.  I I appreciate that you care about your existence that you care about your expression of so that's good.  Instrumentalization is the case all the time.  Did you see any gradual movement to create the stable here or was it simply, there so every manifestation of an instant manifestation because in fact, as some of you who have come here more often know for my teaching is that you're actually consciousness shifting through different slides, different configurations of the universe.  You are not literally creating or manifesting anything physically, structurally speaking, it's not possible because from the point of view of consciousness.  Yes consciousness, shall we say there is no time.  Imagine for a moment there not being any time there not being any time there is no time if there is the absence of time and everything that can exist already has to exist.  You can't create anything new.  It all exists 20,000 billion years from now is already here.  Any alternate reality, configuration of what we would call from our position here in this universe 20,000 billion years from now exist right here right now it has to because there's no time and everything can exist does exist so that already exists where the inside your conscious home in infinite creation exists in one central meeting point in that meeting point is conscious, the free agent aware you and you is your I am individuation are pouring a portion of yourself out into particular linear, seemingly linear reality and so your consciousness moves through a particular understandable logical sequence of parallel universes all the time.  Every second you're doing this.  Millions, billions of times so fluently so fluidly that you don't have any idea that half of the time you don't exist.  Every other not a second.  Nothing is here and in every other nanosecond.  There's another frame, another configuration of energy nova configuration of creation, showing up inside your consciousness know if you do this 1 billion times every second like a light switch flickering on and off 1 million times a day per second.  How would you know but once you get this, it starts to make sense because movement you start instinctively know that movement is an impossibility.  Change is not possible, structurally speak change is not a possibility, something that is cannot become something else.  It's impossible very logical, maybe not yet but at some point will be very logical, something that is cannot become something else is impossible.  A frame will always be that frame and every parallel reality is in a timeless stasis it already existed before you had any awareness of your sense of self and will always exists 20,000 billion years from now episodes of every reality you ever experience in every reality you will ever choose to experience because it's relevant for you to experience that reality already exist right here right now parallel to each other inside of the I am here now consciousness which you Sherry, in which you are ultimately something that is cannot change yet.  We ask for an exchange weeks brings movement of the possible.  If something can change because were not actually changing what is were shifting through an alternate configuration of what seems to be here, which implies that every nanosecond you have a 100% completely different body enters a 100% completely different son is a 100% completely different Milky Way galaxy that your conscious like projector light shining through the pictures that together form a motion picture is not a movie it's pictures in motion.  Although the pictures themselves are not in motion but a generous illusion of motion through pictures right now you have a 100% different body.  That's the only way you can change you can grow your hair is not possible.  You can only shift a body that has a different configuration of the length of the tear like you said your unconscious is hyper conscious superconscious business was taking care of C might be wondering shut and pretty intelligent for me to move through all these alternate Pella realities.  And while focused on the relationship with something or to something in this world seemingly lost in the sense of separation and illusion and circumstances seeming real simultaneously.  I manage that every billionth of a second.  I'm moving into power configuration of this universe where my body has a slightly longer structure of hair.  It's pretty amazing, and is just one aspect of things that you constantly regulate the what we call the unconscious is really superconscious the mixer and this is what is or.  We could simply assertive generally call it the higher self or higher consciousness and it is what is generating our reality in the way that we are generating a reality.  It is what is regulating our agreements.  It is what is deciding what is next and what is next and what is next, so that you from your lower self pointed consciousness can actually be the participant in your own creation, seemingly separate, but not really seemingly the receiver but still actually the giver to itself so that it can then focus only on the plate inside of the state.  Jenna doesn't need to worry about the stage itself.  The stage is set.  You can change the stage but the stage is taken care of for you.  Gravity is here it's all regulated.  That way your hair grows, etc. the earth orbiting shifting the always parallel realities.  But then seem to form a linear causal reality is all taken care of for you and is providing you with the state.  You need to lay out your individual theme so you can learn so that you can express yourself from a very limited point of view but the expansion you gain from eating from a limited point of view is massive in a way we could almost say that the more consciousness limits itself from his lower self point of view, the more it seemingly becomes this individual in a play, even though from a higher point of view is regulating the very universe that exists in every billionth of a second from this point of view, the learning that is extracted ads to the expansion of that so consciousness, the I am consciousness that is at the core of your individuation.  We could call it soul them except you can change the stage.  Yes you do it all the time.  Sure, so she says she's confused about the concept of the paradox about the stage is already set.  You can change what is and you can't write the stage is taken care off for you but every billionth seconded disappears and reappears in a similar state the stomach, so it's never stepped in that sense, you just because it's relevant for your experience to be in a similar reality you keep automatically generating a similar reality that looks very much like the previous parallel slide of the but nothing is that sunset.  Now if you as an individual you a US this shall we say lower self is is learning an accelerated rate.  For example, there's different ways to change the stage but if you're learning at an accelerated rate and you're actually extracting all the benefit that your soul want you to extract from that particular stage you at some point reach a point of renegotiation of reviewing while you're still alive.  Now if you're really really slow.  This won't happen until you leave your fast.  This will happen multiple times throughout your single life.  What I'm talking about is that as you are learning and extracting benefit and your you're developing the theme that you're here to develop as soon as she reached urban end of a particular lesson that your consciousness wants you to learn as soon as you've learned pre-much all there is to learn about that you are very much back in the creator seat you are back in that neutral space in the sense of like hey, I've completed one chapter.  What would I like to write next what is this particular life conducive for in terms of another type of lesson.  Another type of the work can be a subsection being added to being infused into this particular lifetime that is part of the other theme or an extension of the other theme or expansion expansion pack of your previously but in that sense, I mean you can change the state; the great things yes and is that that change not already on some level set as well.  Like if 20,000 20 billion years is already here.  There is no time that change not already or not I think we clarify thinking that everyone your question so I mentioned 20,000 billion years from now already exists, a 20,000 billion years from now is a thought we have here and now, from the point of your consciousness.  It's not 20,000 billion years.  It's now so it's parallel to know what from our agreed-upon linear cosmological reality seems to be 20,000 billion years from now consciousness is right now, so there is no time future is not set in stone.  All there is is the now containing infinite parallel reality, which means that in your experience of time 20,000 billion years from now you can experience any single one parallel reality that is relevant for you to ask.  So your 20,000 billion years from now in your time of experience, even though it already exists does not have to be the one that I mention the because it's parallel it.  If there is no time so you're all shifting through a parallel reality all the time and you can choose your consciousness chooses your whole being chooses what to move into next from its own point of view.  You can say there is year centers timeline, but from consciousness.  There is no such thing is just moving from this picture to that picture to that picture to that picture to that picture.  So there's no saying what in your experience may be the illusion may be generated of 20,000 billion years of been a round here for 20,000 years, you may generate evolution, but it has just been said your subjective experience throughout shifting from this reality that want to that one to that one you feeling like oh I've grown so many years shifting through all these parallel parallel reality but are is not a single slide.  There is not a particular configuration of the universe that actually exists 20,000 billion years from 20,000 billion years for another does not look a certain way it can look like dismal to some other view or it can look like this to you or for some reason 20,000 years from now in your subjective experience of time self generated, which is not real solution.  You may choose to express this moment again so is that 20,000 and you're not already exist you're having it so the structure of creation already exists all the time right here right now how you wish to subjectively relate to that and how you want to generate a sense of time is up to you and where you'll land 20 years from now in your subjective experience will be a structure of creation that already exists for 20 years from now in your time I experienced you'll choose to be aware of that particular frame so your call it 20 years in the mixer you want to see in those woods asking Shauna consciousness is expressing itself.  This is especially yourself right through us.  Excessive fears of physical, the who is wasting the script of the consciousness, knowing that the consciousness is part of a hold that is complete, trying to find a product that door is complete.  What should all differentiate itself to find itself does the hose never complete.  That's why create expert who was complete, we would not have asked for the proponent was that this was no place all day long and on.  It's not linear from the systemic point of view where the home is complete.  It is always difficult to is infinite but is never complete, precisely because it is infinite.  So then okay so it's not complete comes don't to this a script that I'm 60 years old that the have photos over the past 60 years.  Roy is correct the transcript is only it only makes sense from our limited to mice point of view.  Order is a script because things are happening from the point of view of the script writer.  There is no script is just a writing that will is consciousness moving and also to directions in random process or does it have purpose and what is it it's an interesting discussion with the consciousnesses motionless because it has no dimension of his motion.  Muscat has no dimension.  It hastime spine space and time is the generated experience that consciousness generally it is that which is aware of it is not within so does not move around.  That's but I get your question, which is doesn't change his experience with absolutely the purposes to express infinity in for inexperience before because before consciousness is here before awareness was generated by the infinite one unit which is complete in the sense that it's infinite but not complete in the sense that it does not know itself.  This way generates freeware reagents.  This awareness then endowed with infinite intelligence in a workable for can start to generate an infinite universe that all exists now because there is no time and then it can continue to multiply itself into different free agents that we call the on infinite individuation's of itself because it's sole job description from the one is express me how do you express infinity with something as finite as experience you need as many experience this as you can to approach the idea of infinity inform that make sense over its fine gateways is the driving force in writing.  Sorry is the driving.  This process of imaginative love in your presentation.  This is love.  The driving force.  The juice that keeps this system going.  Is it anyway is the infinite, out of love and away the I mean you could call the need or the desire to know itself.  You could call that love.  So how to attract and amazing things instant versus gradual decision so first of all, since you know there is only consciousness and you are it.  Your consciousness, you also realize that all experiences are generated through you and inside of you and bought you that that makes your like you're always projecting a movie inside of your own sphere of your I am consciousness.  You're always seeing your own movie projected onto your own screen, even if it seems to include mountains 200 miles from here.  That is still projected inside of your I am here and now consciousness, just like in your dream at night months exist inside of your mind itself can't seem here the wall behind me, even though it seems to be 20 feet away from you exists inside of your awareness of it as an experience only it doesn't actually accept as an experience inside of your crotch.  So you're always projecting a movie onto the inside of the sphere of your I am cut all star but it's all I am here you're all experiencing your eye and in particular for particular configuration.  So since you know that consciousness will always be here now and is not moving and that's it also helps you to realize when it comes to actually mastering your vibratory state of being.  And with that attracting an amazing life in the realm of the movie the generate a movie that is amazing to you that reflects to you more of who we truly are that you can extract benefit from even even more even quicker and give benefit to even quicker, more more rapidly accelerating your themes culmination your your themes expression.  You know consciousness is always here so you're not actually moving from here to there.  Here not actually getting anywhere you're always the center of your vortex you're always the center of your creation, you are through which experiences are manifested were seemingly made manifest or made visible, more accurately because they already exist.  Every potential configuration every potential movie picture already exists, but the sequence in which you make this visible to yourself depends on your vibratory state depends on what you're sending out the fence and what you want to learn to fence and what's relevant for you depends on your beliefs depends on your expectations US the observer generate your conscious sorry generate your dream generate your movie.  Whether that's consciously or not, so one of the most important things to remember when it comes to attracting a life that is amazing to you is that you are the attraction is not out there is not over here you are the point of attracting.  You are the magnet that attracts different slides of creation so you can always stay right here you can always be yourself.  You can always be grounded in the here and the now of who you are in a state of appreciation in the state of joy.  This state of joyful anticipation, yet without anxiety without like beliefs.  In other words, so with no like believes ideally with no light believes you know that all exists inside of you here now consciousness and we need to do to attract an amazing life is activate a different string in your vibration different wavelength in what you emanate in what you send out who you assume yourself to be in who you define yourself to be in this moment she could say Ray here and I think that you have to get something over there whenever you want something whenever something appeals to you whenever something seems to resonate with who you really are something out there seems to be a reflection of what you truly desire who you truly are.  Instead of projecting it to be over there understand that it's a simple reminding you that everything is inside of here and simply activate the frequency that gets triggered when you think of the single thing over there but let go of the idea that it sexually over the let it fill up your vibratory state over here is the makes a very important difference.  Otherwise, you generate the sense of separation.  The sense of causality.  The sense of it's not yet here it's inevitable to generate the sense of it's not yet here.  If you project it what you want is over there the mind is very logical so automatically it will generate a sense of I'm not there yet.  I'm not complete yet.  I'm not happy yet I don't have what I want yet my life is not amazing yet.  And when you feel that way.  That's what you're attracted.  I'm not amazing I'm not there.  I don't have what it even though you think interview what's the secret and that's really all you know about life in the part way you start thinking all these beautiful things that you want for yourself that feel like their extensions of who you are soul or just think that you think you want because you think you're not complete yet.  Whatever it is you can visualize that all you want but is it always comes with a sense of it's over there, you will always generate the sense of is not yet here and not yet here is the feeling that activate certain vibratory state that then sends out.  It's not here.  What do you see back not here even know you keep thinking of the things you want them to know that it's always going to be here.  Let creation cycle through you don't go out of your way ever.  The very fact that you're used to getting going out of your way to get something is already coming from that sense of lacking insecurity, a confident person.  Some if you see someone even just the material plane.  If you see someone that seems to be really successful and really confident even on some levels might be a façade.  Sometimes it may be real.  But what you'll always see is that there is a certain type of confidence a certain type of arrogance, maybe even depending on what it's filtered through in their particular makeup.  However, what all has in common is they don't feel like you have to get out of their way to get what they desire.  It's a certain type of arrogance of everything comes to me people cleaning the things you just go get this for me.  Whatever it is, even if it's a bargain, but there is a similarity there to someone being really empowered, which is the understanding everything cycles through me.  Everything comes to me I don't go anywhere.  I'm lazy.  I'm powerful I'm free.  I'm expensive and in our case, that would be I contain every possible reality.  I desire all that I need to do in order to activate it is to feel that is already here.  When you feel that what you desire is already here and you eliminate all sense of there being a distance a you get instant gratification because you feel as if there's no difference between having it or not having it and be it will actually show up in some fashion.  The make them so be arrogant.  That way the mean use kindness or compassion or lower integrity simply means you're arrogant enough to know that you are the center of this universe that you are God's a certain type of arrogance but is also the truth the one is very arrogant, but it cannot be negatively arrogance because it all knows that it's only the only thing the sister is only the only thing the rest arrogance is not really an option.  And it's my but from our point of view.  The one is very arrogant because it contains everything that the so be like because of be free be powerful feel like everything cycles through you comes to you don't got your if you're going out of your way you're already defining there to be some kind of black and when you do find that to be some kind of black you will activate that in the vibratory state of your being and then the mirror that you project the movie that you project onto the inside of the sphere of your I am consciousness is seemingly three or four dimensional world.  Will start to generate images that reflect how you feel what you believe what you put out so be mindful of what you put out and let it always be a state of fulfillment of some kind.  If you notice that there something that you desire that is not here right now.  Physically note is that think of a thing or imagine or embody the energy of the thing that you desire and what it triggers and you what you wanted.  Whether that symbolized certain state of being a certain feeling feeling good.  Feeling amazing that a trigger that feeling of amazement and let go of all sense of here.  First, is there now persistent separation lack isolation and just feel what it feels like to be that complete and when you do that a you have instant gratification and be the thing that wants to come to you can actually show up to you because her not keeping it away by feeling like it's not you gave you keep saying it's not here yet it's not I want that so much I want a relationship I want that car without house I want their career.  I want that job change I want that stated be.  I want the state of the realization whatever it is, but I wanted I want that one over there.  It can come to what you're sending out is it's over there and it goes okay.  I'll keep making it appear over there over there over there.  I sure yes it's over there okay as well.  You have to be careful not to be too reflective of what is be more creative of what you want be more in the creative space.  The mind is not reflective is creative in nature.  Whatever you think is in the process of becoming something becoming an experience more fully embodied experience so don't just randomly think and reflect upon what is is that that's real because you only continue to reassert what is and then your next parallel reality shift which is 100% completely different universe.  No structural relationship to the previous one whatsoever 100% different will have to look similar to your previous creation because you keep sending out what your you know you have to in a sense become a little bit delusional syllabus where you let go of what it you stop reasserting what is so that change can actually happen because change happens through you to you towards you which shows up for you.  So if you want what you seek to change you need to change about the state if you keeping too much attention to what actually is a very true state will continue to reflect your previous vibratory state which has been made manifest three circumstances would you not reflect the people think it's real.  And then what you send out to your future image is the same thing.  And so the same thing will show up so if you wish to accelerate the manifestation or the attraction of an amazing life, you need to be in a state of change with a certain changeability.  You have to be able to wander within your own stated be you have to be able to not tie how you feel to what shows up very difficult very challenging.  Yes, if you wish to accelerate the attraction of an amazing life within your movie within your creation which is all up to you.  You deserve everything you desire because it's your creation.  If your theme's up to you.  You have to be willing and able and conscious enough to not tie how you feel about yourself and about life to what is what is should no longer dictate how you feel what appears now should no longer be an indication of who you are.  If you can detach your state of being from your circumstances and your circumstances will continue to reflect you before you know it you start understand that you're not separate from your experience, you're not separate from your circumstances, but all they do is reflect you never the other way around.  They move through you ever the other way around.  You never move the circumstances they reflect your state of being.  You learn from it.  You decide what you'd rather want to experience.  Next, you activate that in your frequency field, not believing that it has to be dependent upon house think show up and thinks will actually show up in a way that's in alignment with how you chose to feel regardless of your previous or the mix.  Can y'all do that the few you can do that or do you take your circumstances to seriously yes that needed at this the data through the many people do.  That's what we teach each other.  We teach each other to pay attention to what is all the time.  This is real attention to what is don't be too happy is nothing in your circumstances indicate that you should be.  So why are you smiling when your mom is dying.  Why would you can I be happy when my mom's dying can be happy when my Empire.  This appears has a significant,, are you able to declare should be attach your state of being from your circumstances, you said yes but are you, thank you so can you stop taking your cue from your circumstances are challenging as very subtle as a very subtle endless learning curve and I include myself in that learning is endless degrees of being able to no longer look at your circumstances at all then you're in the state of the nonphysical, then you're in a higher vibratory state, which is much closer to the actual state of your heart.  So what happens you'll see that much more.  You access to that much more love that much more with them that much more connection that much more freedom that much more apartment all because you have learned to positively ignore your circumstances without ignoring your integrity.  There's a difference ignoring circumstances does not mean to ignore your sanity or your integrity.  It simply means to not take your cue from what is this the how you should feel and choose your next reality.  The make sense.  The difference, you can be in complete integrity and complete compassion towards all of your creation without taking any cue from them or that which is as to how you should induce your state of being with the feeling that you can choose whatever feeling you wish to induce yourself with the is not dependent on what appears it's not your movement that since your energetic movement is completely unaffected by circumstance circumstances do not transmit state of being a can't.  This table does not give me a feeling I give me a feeling based on my ideas about the stable of you starts laughing in the face.  Jim that does not transmit a feeling into me.  I will experience nothing that I won't feel anything physically the nervous system.  One flareup in the consciousness one register that sensation.  What I'm saying is that how I feel about that and how I let that affect when I choose.  Next in terms of how I feel about myself and life in general.  What I believe what my conviction is for the next moment is not transmitted to me by your hand, your molecules slipping my molecules infect your molecules are my molecules and these are yours.  The matter anyway so your site between the phase and because I have a definition about that being really pleasurable my state of being.  This is also not based on a real store just hypothetically, my city being will feel amazing.  I will infuse my city being with him.  I got the feeling this is amazing.  This is great is so that the next reflection will be that he slept me harder because that's what I happen to like to know if I did not like that if I did not like him slipping me around, but I still do find it in a positive way, will happen next is that he stops flapping face because that's what actually so if you want to receive what you actually desire you have to define what is in the most positive way possible.  Why, because if you do find something to be positive to be in your best interest.  Your frequency will align itself with the vibratory state you wish to experience in the next moment since you've chosen to already experience it now regardless of what happened your reality can actually reflect and so you're attracting to you very rapidly and amazing life would be helpful to have an instant shift from where you're at, to the ultimate dream that you desire would it be beneficial to have that experience instantaneously.  Would it be interesting for you to have exactly everything you want right now would be would it not be cool.  Maybe it's different for everyone.  For me it's not that interesting because it feels unreal is not interesting.  The part is so interesting about being physically focus is that there seems to be progress that there seems to be some gradual nature some linear transition from where I am to where I want to be and it is through the gradual learning curve rapid as it may be nothing not to accelerate.  I'm seeing if you would skip 20 years and end up in who you can be 20 years from now you would have no knowledge of anything that happened in between the how valuable would that be how interesting was that universe look to you.  If you have no context understand by your what you're looking how would with that really give you a greater sense of evolution greater sense of expansion with that really add to the sense of having overcome of having empowered of having transport it would just be like a dream and we already have that on the nonphysical level.  That's why it's not that interesting.  That's why this is interesting as a limitation of interest.  That's why the gradual illusion of the linear physical reality is an interesting focus to spend some time with re-creating because now you can make sense out of things you can in a sense, paste the story onto it and I don't mean that in the drama driven victim story sense.  I mean story in a more holistic way you as consciousness are now adding story to creation your adding relationship to creation your adding novels to creation.  That's how expensive that's how it expands upon itself is through storytelling and again I mean in a very holistic energetic way storytelling adding novels to adding stories, adding lifetimes to creation.  That is how to expense upon its relationship to the structure that already exists in the timeless stasis state.  The universe cannot expand upon what is possibly configurable is that already exists, it expands itself through how it relates to that and what order it goes from this one to that one to that one and if it even want to go this one for that.  What that one.  Maybe this particular I am consciousness was to go from this wanted this one for creating a completely new story out of the infinite possibilities that are already timelessly created and don't expect them the value of being physically focus is that you tell a story to creation that has never told itself before that is how you are valuable.  That's how your expansion occurs.  So there is that balance between gradual and instant manifestation.  You always instantly manifest the next frame, but from the story subjective logical point of view, you're going to make that seemingly gradual.  I'm not saying you're not going to accelerate it going to accelerate this to great expense to her you feel less and less and less limited and more and more like it is a dream.  But what is so unique and beautiful about this particular timing is that you learn how to gradually increase the acceleration of your changing from one parallel reality to another in a very conscious fashion.  Bottom line feel amazing about where your cassettes about to disappear and change it to something you.  This is interesting.  I'm nothing.  Take your cue from what appears and what your parents have told you the way that things appear right now should mean to you how you should feel about that completely.  Always empower yourself to feel about what you see in a completely new way.  It's up to you is your mother dying absolutely awesome.  Have a party be happy or not up to you this because your parents told you that's a really sad event just because everyone's wearing black.  I love black doesn't mean that you cannot show off being happy.  Of course there's this thing called respect and integrity.  You can honor that Lopez you cannot to rapidly expand other people's worlds, but insight you can be happy and to an extent, to the outside.  You can start with was the overflow that piece full confidence that everything is into those around you at that can,, and maybe even where party hats depending on what your family is like and whether they tend to bring their shotguns to funeral but it is entirely up to you how you feel how you perceive any given circumstantial mode.  There is nothing set in stone.  Nothing inherently transmits the state of being into you.  It's all subjectively self generated self defined and are is nothing in creation that suggests that one particular experience should be experienced in a certain way.  Nothing in creation that suggests except for a law book and you human brains in the collective consciousness and all the morals that we've agreed on in the traditions and the lineages in a level ship aside from that nonsense that is man-made.  There is nothing inherent in the structure of creation that suggests that a particular configuration of molecules should mean you feel bad whatsoever.  There is not a single configuration of molecules that inherently structurally suggests that you should feel certain way about it.  In other words all the time with infinite creations of this universe are neutral and without meaning you are there to tell the tale.  You are there to generate the story and how free you are in being him to generate that story for yourself according to your own-tuition and desires will determine what configuration of the universe will fall into your slide next to show you the reflection of your chosen state of being and in this way you can very consciously and with no ego just because you are a desire is being just because you are in the line being this because you are a passionate expression of creation wanting to tell as many tales as you can.  And as beautiful and epic away as you can because that is what expense upon the universe.  Nothing else will only you can expand upon this universe.  Nothing else will.  It is your duty, your job, your honor your desire to be of service to the creator by telling an epic tale.  Nothing.  Everyone should become an action hero or spiritual teacher or a famous rock star epic can look like anything the most epic reality is if it's in alignment with who you feel you truly are free from blockages and negative definitions picked up along the way.  Realizing that you can clear out all these negative definitions and this is what empowerment and acceleration is and apply and paste your own new definitions subjective perspectives onto every single inherently neutral and meaningless configuration of molecules left to see someone quote me.  That's an circumstances do not create your state of being.  It's the other way this is the bottom line of the apartment teaching when you get that you become more more non-physically connected and intent with yourself.  You come from a nonphysical focus and yes you notice the physical focus, but is just the tail end of your expression of who you are.  It's no longer the dominating factor indicating and giving Kuester how you should feel what you should do.  We should respond to you are now God you are now creator creator.  You are now as you are created to be in the image of the creator the image of the Creator is not the created the image of the Creator is another creator is that its exact image the created is its opposite.  If you are created in the image of your Creator that does not mean you're the opposite.  It means you're created in the image of your Creator, which means your creator right so you are a creator, you can't help creating.  You can only make it so unconscious that it seems like everything is happening for you and then you get these really really boring spiritual teacher teaching story that talk about.  There is no free will everything just have yes but who do you think is doing your the receiver of your experiences only because you are also the giver of your experience so that grace that you surrender to from its own point of view is your hire you and the more you separate yourself from that which is creating your experiences the more you feel victimized and separate and that there is no free will, which is the antichrist is the end.  I thought it does not exist.  No free will does not exist.  Everything contains free will.  The more you give that sorry I'm separate from a creator, even if you call it innocence, even if you call it Eagle list is still a fallacy fill in ignorant perspective of creation still not true, you're still separating your vibratory state from that of your hire true self, which is creating everything you see here right now if you want to get closer to that true love.  The true wisdom that true connection to true humility that true selflessness.  You need to become more is the creator.  If you cannot become more like in vibration by separating yourself from that which creates all that it you have to become more like.  Always honor your integrity always honored integrity of other people's free will.  Other beings free will, course live with as much compassion and kindness and love and generosity as you can't.  Those are not mutually exclusive.  In fact, this becomes more natural as you learned that there is no lack of your creative ability and so you feel overflowing with empowerment and comfort because you know that you're in control of your reality all the time on some level, the more you download is knowing the more you like in your frequency onto the frequency of the creator of your higher self,, and the more you'll be endowed with the selflessness that are natural quality of the heart status you can't be selfless pretending to be trying to be.  Selflessness is a natural expression of you getting closer in your frequency to be truly are.  Who are you are you the victim's got the victim's your hires of the victim.  No.  Lang victim of the she want to be selfish, selfish and insistent and arrogant.  Even in your humility.  I know nothing.  I have no power to create your relative.  While that is true because it's you but you have to become at your own pace at your own comfort level.  More and more and more as the creator in and you have to not be afraid of embracing your power you have to know that you're a good person that you are an abundant being that does not proceed like and therefore does not need to steal happiness from others in order to be happy him or herself.  This is where the false humility story comes into play like well if I am powerful than other people must like if I am happy to know the people must be looking happy if I'm have actually be happy by stealing it from you considers only so much water on this planet.  Users only so much money in the bank is only so much happiness around man-made thoughts not God made the is gutsy life.  How does the creator sea life.  How is your higher self perceive this moment as one of many infinite possible realities all coexisting right here right now with no lack for anyone in any aspect of that is how it sees creation.  If you want to become more like it.  You have to see more as itsy.  How do you do that clear out any perspective that makes you feel better.  That's what a guidance system of the emotional body comes in.  It is your higher self letting you know the fastest way to merge with it to become more like it in for an expression whenever you feel bad.  It is letting you know that your placing your vibration further away from the truth of creation.  Whenever you feel good.  It's letting you know that the way you see life is rooted in a vibrational state, a position that is closer in alignment to the way that the creator sees itself.  That's what feels amazing in order to attract an amazing life.  Pay attention to when you feel that transform the negative perceptions that distort you further away from the one and replace it with a perspective that is holistic, beautiful, compassionate and abundant than infinite in nature and you feel instantly better.  Why because the emotional body is not a random mechanism, although we've polluted it quite a bit make it seem random but it is a very clear guidance system.  Even now in our polluted state of higher self communicating to lower self whether or not our perspective is right or wrong.  Very simple yes there is right and wrong.  That's not value while everyone is wrecked.  Everyone has validity equal validity, but in terms of your perspective being correct or incorrect.  That's absolutely there and incorrect perspectives still add to the expansion of creation, but still allowed is still valid.  It still loved.  However, from a very individual relative point of view.  The quickest way to become more as your higher self already is to notice when you feel that change your perspective to one that feels amazing, which is literally or herself entering your being letting you know.  Thank you for widening your channel to receive more of me.  This is what feels good when it feels that it means your contracting yourself you're pinching your squeezing the flow, the amount of flow of higher self.  It is possible for you.  So something is half up.  Something is happening.  Something is incorrect in the way you see life in order to accelerate your expansion which will always be your graduate as long as you're physically focused, but that's beautiful.  That's about is to expand to open up to receive more joy to know you're worth the of joy.  First of all, just to think you're not worthy of joy is already in out of alignment perspective as long as you believe you're unworthy of feeling good you love yourself to feel good, so check in before even try this empowerment thing see if you believe you're worth the a feeling or whether that's a bad thing.  A sinful thing and egotistical thing.  My teacher told me I'm should not feel good about feel good.  It's not an acceptance is not an flow I should feel bad be really happy about should feel bad and accepted as it is not move.  Just don't move on.  Thank sorry or are you lot to be happy, which is the way the universe communicates with it.  So after understand that beyond the human level, there is only infinite bliss.  There is no justification there is no cost and effect.  If you want to become her expanded more selfless, more true in your view of life yes to let go of the human view of life which is rooted in lack and unworthiness true.  It's valid.  It's an expression of the incident but is not true is not correct, it doesn't feel good because it's not whatever is true is good truly holistically peacefully good and excitingly good.  Just like I had this feels good, but underneath.  I know I did something I stole this happiness from someone else and now I think I feel good for moment, but no not really.  That's not the type of happiness.  I speak to happiness the feeling good.  I speak of is a holistic overflowing of good feeling amazing about yourself no matter what is what creation is like all the time.  Aside from inside the human mind bubbles.  Even the human mind spiritual.  If you truly wish to develop a true view have to let go of the human view, including the religious and the spiritual and self-realization human you got it really be selfless enough to get past all your barriers of sin unworthiness and being afraid of your arrogance, which is the most arrogant thing to do to be afraid of becoming arrogant American the think that when you expand, you will become more egotistical as a possible.  The ego is the substance servant that takes care of us when we don't was the worst way to take care of yourself by feeling bad all the time and reinforcing that believing that that's how I should feel then of course the ego affect Dixon wants to take care of you.  Make sure you're all right.  Make sure you're safe.  Paradoxically, the ego affect free state does not appear humble per se.  It appears bright and Lumina and shiny and generous and free and epic and also in radiant and powerful and it's tense apt, but only because no one else that's not because it is our extends out because everyone else insists upon something that's not true and they're closing down their channel.  Then someone that opens up will stand up.  We'll see more shiny.  We'll see more arrogant only because you don't listen to the arrogant people in this world learn from that of a negative way.  Learn from them in a harmonious learn from the coffin.  The people learn from the shiny people, whether in the feel of spirituality or not.  I don't care can be a business owner is highly successful and yes it may have a lot of misperceptions regarding the nature of reality, but learn from their state somehow and apply it to your own harmonious integral knowing the goodness that you are such shining yourself.  Start reading, start feeling more expanded beyond your chest beyond your body more you feeling closed by the body.  The more that is a sign that you're seeing things and in correct way.  Yes there is incorrect ways of seeing interest more correctly see more accurate were relevant more precise, more harmonious more in line with all that is being one inseparable being of infinite abundant so shine especially when no one else the step on your toes.  They insist that their toes right in front of your feet as that's what happened is when you start shining you attract both more of the shininess as well as the opposite, making its unconsciousness more conscious to itself.  How will it do that it will attract certain shiny standout examples and will bash them or embrace learn from them consciously or learn from them unconsciously, but learn from what they attract they will let everyone learn from you.  That's part of your service in whatever way they choose to learn positively or negatively accepting or rejecting an resistance or an flow do not be afraid to shut,, or do whatever feels best whatever feels more precise, accurate and correct for you.  But if we could all light up a little bit more than no one else would have to stand out as much as we all in the know when the hundred years from the other won't be spiritual teachers as we know hopefully be redundant, be absolutely redundant spirituality will cease to exist as amendment concept.  The medical is talking about life sucking about creation spirituality is an antidote to having constricted our flow.  All are you spiritual person any chance have just discovered that I don't feel good all the time and want to explore what it's like to extend myself are you spiritual person can relate to you that one exist anymore.  No, I'm not a spiritual person.  It's just the right.  It is movable spirituality does not exist.  It is a man-made concept.  It is for those that wish to escape but also the view that there is no spirit that there is no consciousness that there is nothing more is also incorrect.  But spirituality is an antidote temporarily necessary to take us out of the compressed state contracted state into the expanded state watcher in the expanded state.  You see the inseparability of life and the brilliance of all that is and where is spirituality.  Where is the spiritual person versus the non-spiritual being was the one who is conscious versus the one that somehow not conscience it will cease to exist.  Hopefully it will eventually so when we all stand out when we all shine than no one stands up and all will be brilliant their own way in her own right and accepted and learn from and everything will accelerate.  Do not be afraid to shine.  It is what this wrote me the best way to be whistleblower on the occurrence of human is to show is mean you have to speak out, necessarily, as I do, you can keep quiet.  You want but by radiating you will say so much more in your tent from the contracted stated the happy no matter what.  Show people that they have the option to redefine the neutral appearance of the configuration of molecules that solidus configuration of molecules which is energy which is conscious.  We can choose how we wish to respond to something all the time.  What we wish to create what we wish to generate how we wish to feel how we wish to perceive this show people that have this choice by being an embodiment of don't long for instant manifestation of your amazing life because it keeps your pace slow.  Why does she keep seeing it is not yet here and will have to respond to that dipping here.  I went instant manifestation.  I want nothing now in other words, I don't have it now and life goes you don't have it now.  Okay you have an let go that insert depreciating the curve that you're in the upwards accelerating gradual graduating curve that your rent of accelerating the pace of your gradual manifestation so that the story make sense to you and you can actually enjoy every stage of and the more conscious you are yourself, the more in alignment you're with yourself, the quicker you learn from every single second.  The more you extract from every single second.  The more unconscious you are the more it takes years to learn what the conscious person learns in a single second so the more you become conscious, then yes, the more your manifestation abilities.  Seemingly, although there already at the perfect maximum capacity will start to reflect that ability to accelerate the instant the manifest things more and more quickly and frequently, but only because the one who more quickly manifest not because they skip thing but because they learn quicker from what it because are more conscious of what it not what is in the circumstantial sense ago.  This is must feel this way, what is meeting this shows up right now it's a reflection of who I am.  What do I want next.  I want this next owed is a reflection of why what what is to teach me all this is not will feel quite the way I thought it would.  This however is amazing, full amazing is here right now and then it reflects itself again.  All witnesses reflected me.  So the more consciously you learn the more quickly within the similar seemingly lifespan reality you manifest, but not because you're skipping steps, but because your learning more efficient.  You need a last time to bring something to your attention them except you can't skip ahead of your theme.  You wouldn't want to skip ahead of your own thing.  Only the mind rooted in the idea something is lacking now thinks a desire but your true being desires to tell every single step of the story of fun would it be to read a book and then to go from one page to the other so we notice you missing a couple of scenes with I have no context understand is not interesting at the same is the case from the hearts of point of view and from the personal consciousness point you want to know what happens every step of your way of your theme.  No learn faster, be more attentive be more excited about what appears and what it shows you how you wish to re-create what is and how you wish to re-create what is and how you wish to re-create what is and how you wish to feel regardless of what is how you wish to feel regardless what is and how you wish to feel regardless of what it so that what it takes someone else to take 10 years to learn and express the manifest picture today that his acceleration is not skipping ahead of yourself.  It is learning more efficient.  A little side note to that little disclaimer to the one that is in the accelerated stage II days will feel like to you a perfect way to practice patient by learning that the way is if you're not waiting.  You don't need patient.  How can you not wait by being in full joy, regardless of what I'm saying is yes, you'll accelerate what takes someone else to pay attention to into your time spent to do so unconscious and not willing in that moment to face themselves to make contact with their direct experience their own creation.  Those two days to you if you like to you so you still have the same sense of when this is coming when it does have it's been two hours.  My new house hasn't arrived yet with the apps where someone else to learns that the pace of two years would you do in today's and you're moving the notes as possible.  You're like what I guess I can see that from your point of view.  I also think you know appreciate my flow that much more in one house, because you were in appreciation of your flow you change your state of being.  So always be in appreciation as much as you can be in confidence as much you can think everything is a sign that things are working out that you are being amazing that you are learning.  Always enjoy your present learning curve by knowing that it's awesome then what will always be gradual, will excel by the end of a single lifetime.  You have written such an epic story for that even though 20 years ago you thought you turn it into a book by then you would know where to start.  But you know that the book has been written.  The story has been told that all the evidence exists in the storage that many beings along side you have learned from your story.  In fact, all of creation is learn from your store so the book has been written be the example be the expansion be the accelerated learning be your own point of attraction your own creator.  Everything else will benefit after all there's only one in question three of the microphone fixed it so with the usher with the assertion my will to be happy with the one with the assertion of my will to stay happy and be happy regardless of what is think you will or not be a should start there might be of the unconscious unfurling and testing my conviction of that happiness you so as ready you may you are left perfect way for you consciously show up.  That's why the shifts firm is required at some point shift storms are no longer required in the way that they used to be.  Amassing no challenging intersections where everything comes together in a culminating fashion won't appear to you.  They will continue to appear.  You continue to have beginnings of your chapters and endings and beginnings and endings learnings and integration and expansion, etc. these waves of creation of expansion and integration expansion and integration expansion integration peaks and valleys peaks and valleys.  They will always continue to occur especially with the physical focus being so parents to your consciousness right now being here.  However, with most people cautious or which is where everything has to go wrong when everything you have built has to disappear or just taken away from you with no sign of anything else reappearing.  That's better.  Everything just seems to continuously negatively create itself is a perfect way for your unconscious the show itself your conscience because what is it showing you it's showing you that your definitions are negative.  To begin, you have a set of negative definition, a set of I'm unworthy of hopeless.  I'm not capable of total bliss.  This is just not the way the universe works there is limitation there is isolation for everything good that happens to be too bad thinks it happened to me.  No pain no gain always believes are start to show up for you, which is a good sign.  It means you're transcending if you were not transcending them they would not show up to you.  Can she would not have any context understand them in your heart of his medical being does not beat you lessons you don't have the capacity to consciously take so if a shift arises.  It's a great complement to your already present learning curve and send them except the shooter year.  The store, the more capable.  You have become semi-so first of all, the compliment and when you define the next coming the next upcoming shift sermon that way and you start seeing it is a beautiful cyclone and citizens should store and you see it as a blister, then you are already at least halfway about 80 to 90% there to extracting all the benefits that that list storm cyclone is there to show you to become the thing it wants to show you most is that you have control over how you define your circumstance.  I was at the first inkling of the shifts were rising.  You start immediately program yourself to define it in the most blissful way you've already learned almost all the things that the passage and it will not be should storm it will actually turn out to be a blister.  What starts out as a shifts room can be immediately turned around to become a blister depending on how you revise your freedom to what extent you realize you're free to find that wont yes you storm appears in your old definitions but in your new definitions does no longer should start is now amazingly appreciated and assign your ascendance and so you're absolutely stoked at the side of the system which is notably cyclone and it will spin you into orbit.  We use your shift storms wisely so that they in that fashion will never have to show up because they won't be relevant for you to see that have been integrated all benefit has been extracted and learned witches.  This is not a should start this is your own self talking to which is benign and blissful.  Once you get in that concert to communicate you in two is a lighter way more enjoyable way less destructive, less chaotic, less random, less unconscious way it can start to simply communicate you now at some point you start to learn most of your lessons before they ever have to be made.  Most little start to learn on the level of imagination because you become snappy.  You just you become more attentive because you start to see more how you communicate with yourself and everything is inseparable self creation to know the first sight of a negative thought, you're already paying attention to what your vibration beyond the thought was why did I even have a negative thought.  Oh, I must of had the conviction that there's a lack of money, there's a lack of this order, the lack of awesome leg does not exist in the universe.  Why let me align myself with the reply, which is infinite abundance, infinite, endless parallel realities anything can change it.  Second, it is not abundant enough or think you know you feel totally different about that same scenario and you've learned before it has had to meet been manifest in terms of bankruptcy or anything like that; so you paid attention to your repertory state again and again more and more.  You will become a vibrational wonder, another situational you start to master your vibration not your situation.  The quicker you learn the more use keep it right here right now don't get everything cycles through you, knowing that everything is up to you knowing it.  Everything is here to show you something, and everything is here to ask you something to is here to show you what you previously gave to ask and it is here to now after you.  What do you wish to give me next which I will show you in a minute creation what you want to tell me.  Next I'll give it to you in a minute you believe there is infinite abundance okay what how do you wish to respond to this was reflecting its reflecting what you previously told me what would you like now that you see the manifestation of what you previously told me, whether consciously or unconsciously, is why many people are very successful because them.  If you unconscious beliefs that are in alignment with the universe like you, what would you like to tell Mina what would you like for me to create unit you go over let's see more infinite bliss.  Okay.  Thank you once a sign on the goats know if you do the common thing which is the negative cycle which is to respond to what is shown to you.  Hey, what you think about this.  This is what you told me yesterday or two minutes ago what you think.  What this I'm speaking of creation creation is like Halo you go.  This is what you told me to get for you two seconds ago two minutes ago two hours ago two days ago to years ago.  Whatever what is the showing you are you making it more consciously integrating what you see is a reflection of your unconscious beliefs and making it more conscious and transforming it and aligning it in alignment with the universal way of seeing the and what would you like me to get for you if you respond to that in the common way for example, a funeral should be set which there is no indication that it should be wears indication, it should be the dead bodies not suggesting that that is not talking anymore and and the board is not suggesting it the grave is not suggesting the flames are not suggesting the coffee cheap coffee, suggesting or maybe the Jeep but other than that there's nothing inherent to the circumstances just the funeral should be set you do your memory of your parents to your memory of your other people.  Your peers are so much we bring to each creation asking us hello, this is what you told me
the last time learn from this and now what would you like to see.  Next we so often unconsciously respond to that with beliefs that are have never been our own.  That's what if you so happy because they're not art anything you carry with you.  That's not yours feel have so you keep saying, well yeah it's showing you funeral what would you like to see next.  While this is really sad okay one second.  Someone pushes over the body falls in the ground jaw dropping out.  Well, how would you like to respond to this and you go.  While this is terrible okay one second.  Your unknowing heavy uncle steps backwards and squashes the faith, how would you like to respond to the home I got I can't handle okay and you think this negative.  It's an exaggerated version of what's actually correct us on a day-to-day basis.  If you become more aware of this, you become more in control of by mastering your frequency, not your situation.  Your frequency always respond to what shows up in the way you wishes to appear right next for two.  If you want for that the body cannot be stopped on in the next moment when it already felt about you have to be really excited about the fact that it felt then what you get is a really exciting reflection of that may be that he wasn't at all start standing up in parking anything's possible.  Jesus did when I do be really excited anything everything is a constant reflection of what you say that it is always what you see it as it always becomes, what you say first of the of the microphone picks I understand what you're saying in a personal and a personal way like things happen in your life and how you react to that.  But then, if you take a more global view of that is it the same leg wars in these awful stories that we hear even long manner, whatever that have nothing to do with me personally, but it does because I don't hear them.  Why do certain people here, but the stories all the time because there's attempted to turn on the television.  Nothing.  This is you interesting.  In general, why do they turn on television because there's believes in them that are interested in the nastiness is going on, or the not conscious and enjoying their own life enough to not turn on the television or to not watch the news or read the newspaper.  It's a reflection of your own degree of excitement with your own if is not very high note reconnected than any form of entertainment will do.  In other words, whatever happens out there is extremely personal and there is no difference.  Not really in and a sports in a variety of ways.  One the most obvious one being that if a negative news reaches you and and is interpreted in a negative way to experience this a bad thing then what you'll show up next.  What will show next is more of the bad news because how do you respond to the bad news.  With this is really bad creation goes in one second.  Let me create a new war over here sent Sheedy news reporter over there connect to television.  Hey, anything that anything of that ward.  I just started for you.  Thank you so much for calling the previous one bad so I could reinforce that by starting yet another war all the of all the while the person behind the television is being absolutely arrogant, not understanding that they continue to feed the negativity by feeling so selfless that they complain about how bad the world judging those that don't see the again nothing at all.  This is you just like taking this picture to the extreme and seeing what I often see in people out there, especially those that don't come to my meeting is that they feel so good about this.  This is how low their excitement in their life that they feel the most exciting thing for them is to feel really really good about themselves complaining about how bad the world is and blaming happy people for being happy.  If this is you when we are excited were actually adding to the creation on a global scale is excited.  This is a law of the universe.  If you're not happy you're not helping subjectivism and how many kids you feed in Africa the matter.  If you fat 10,000 kids.  If you were unhappy all the time doing it.  You are destructive force.  You did not help one bit, except in the negative direction that 10,000 kids in Africa single-handedly, but you fat felt bad and projected that they were suffering with every single moment not seeing the goodness in life, you have not helped one bit.  In fact the second half.  Boston thousand kids letter 5000 have been your creation, they would not be starving if you were not unhappy with the first 5000 kids you are feeding.  This is how creation works take responsibility if you want to be selfish.  You need to shine.  I know it's a paradox.  Humanity does not agree so what they don't know what to do.  Humanity has not a clue how this works.  If got to be happy if you're not happy or not helping.  It's a law of the numbers.  If you're not happy or not have help your helping but in negative direction, which is fine.  You can do that, it still expanding from the universe.  But we've done that for millennia, collectively of the global species.  Now it's time to change your perspective so that what we see can actually change what we see can change it.  We don't first change your perspective.  So if you're rooted and are so much misery out there do so much more out there.  Let me help out it may seem like most of the thing to do but it's more selfless to sit your ass down, turn off the television and visualize what it feels like to already have an amazing plan right here right now being born inside of your chest.  Now you're helping is a mix of physical help is only go so far and I'm nothing not to physically help out and not the physically feed kids in Africa and not to physically whatever that's all beautiful, but the extension of it has to be an extension of your joy and your benign perspective of the holistic value of life if you can bring that energy to the physical health is a complete cycle and you'll actually be able to notice opportunities that will actually collectively in a very large scale make complete collective shifts instead of continue to create a negative thing that your file literally in figure so it does work on a global Apple same as it works on personal level, it just requires more personal level to do the same thing to understand the same but again more personal levels.  One is that this the more you with a personal level, understand and articulate,, and very rapidly.  There's going to be this threshold, the stepping point and in a way many ways we've already crossed the sticking point but you know every edition to the momentum and the upward spiraling energy is very helpful one, and there's many thresholds that were passing traffic passing soon as there's a certain amount of beings that are part of the collective agreement that shift their understanding of the collective agreement.  The collective agreement will have to reflect will have to reflect if only one personal being in a very powerful way is very clearly eliminated all like to believe system and they will start to live in a bubble reality that is in a way to an extent detached from the collective agreements that the collective around them.  Suffers from is an unconscious victim of,, and it will generate a universe where things work differently even while seemingly being still inside this world with other people that work in your way and that's why one can say hey while your life was really fast, or I can't believe how happy you are at the funeral or you start to really generate the more clearly aligned you're with yourself, the more individuated your bubble experience of this collective becomes and the more a shining example it becomes to those that can either match or not match your frequent your example you're like you're right the mix and now this bubble reality will start to attract other beings that also have a higher degree of frequency and understanding in alignment with how a source how consciousness sees thing and so it will be like water droplets being attracted to each other, turning into a bigger reality until it is the entirety of our civilization you've turned your personal bubble that was detached from the collective agreements into the new collective before you at least intercept but that can expand and expand into total collective and eventually will, even if not everyone chooses to go along with that the will for girls of collective you will form your own self.  Collectively, these frequencies will depart so far from each other that at some point you will be able to hear, see, perceive or expand each other ever get so your experience will be that the whole civilization has joined you in your revolution in your understand is not necessarily true.  Something that others have split up in other collectives that you no longer have the ability for it to proceed your point of view you're on earth with an enlightened civilization as others that are on earth with a distracted destroyed civilization every choices available have each being, choose for themselves and the only way you can teach them is by being an example by living thank you for living for being for being hit few announcements on.
