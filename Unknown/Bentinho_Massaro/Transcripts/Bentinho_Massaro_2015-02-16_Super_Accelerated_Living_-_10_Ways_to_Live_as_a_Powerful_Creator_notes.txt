1) Be Aware of your vibration and choose it Consciously Now. Don’t base your felt experience and what things look like. Current experiences are based on the vibration you have held in the “past.”
2) Plant new seeds, constantly, by using your imagination to create what excites you the most right now. Overwhelm reality with Waves of Bliss. Don’t wait for results to confirm your choices. Let go of all lack beliefs. Trust your creative process.
3) Care more about feeling good than about any goals. Focus on the state of pure joy/desire and not on being attached to the objects of your desire.
4) Constantly, focus on the non-physical, love-light presence or future-presence or simply be in the Simultaneity.
5) Take in the love and freedom, Now. Leave any fear of lack behind. Keep creating the next creation. (Let go of how and when.)
6) Don’t linger on thoughts about, “what’s not working.” Let go of the story of “the past.” Look at what is working or has worked. Most importantly stay with the “feel good” feelings.
7) Be all in! This is a high stakes game. Keep accelerating you frequency, resonance, vibration!
8) You are the Source of your well being! ( Joy, Love, Freedom and Abundance.) Rediscover you Divinity as Creator God/Goddess.
9) On waking up, very first thing ask, “What vibration am I committed to experiencing today?”
10) Always feel good and be confident! Feeling good is more important than any “thing” that is appearing. Do not wait for results to choose to feel good!
