1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:10,140
Unknown: Don't say let us continue this transmission. Now, first and foremost, before we begin with the meditation,

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:22,560
the electronic experience that you had when we disconnected from the channel, is because we didn't completely disconnect.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:35,580
We thought we'd give you a tiny taste of what's coming up on the 13th with regard to the idea of our presence being a little bit closer, by allowing you

4
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,900
to match our heartbeat.

5
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,480
So

6
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:58,050
this is the very beginning of things to come expressed first in the energy of your devices, but coming closer and closer and closer

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,960
Peace care

8
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,990
unless you find it fun.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,050
And now, allow yourselves to relax.

10
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:24,990
Let go of the cares of the dare. Take a deep breath in and let it out.

11
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:34,770
And continue to breathe deeply and easily as you allow your lights to shift and your music to play,

12
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:37,980
and to begin

13
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,020
the journey

14
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,380
to the portal

15
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,820
at midnight, under the hunter's moon,

16
00:01:49,140 --> 00:02:00,000
because you can begin to project yourselves there now ahead of the physical date, since all things are here and

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,480
Now,

18
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,770
so be with us now.

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,440
In that vortex in Joshua Tree at midnight, under the full Hunter's moon,

20
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,140
stand upon the ground, sit upon the ground lie upon the ground, whatever is your wish

21
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:30,240
and gaze up at the stars and the moon in the clouds of the night sky.

22
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,570
As you feel the energy bill

23
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,360
with anticipation

24
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,480
of an opening

25
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,700
of a door

26
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,670
slowly opening

27
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,530
wider

28
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,940
and wider and wider

29
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,430
so that you may see

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,060
through to the other side, a dimensional doorway, a portal, a vortex.

31
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,780
And on the other side,

32
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,330
other forms of consciousness peeking through that door at you

33
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,920
watching, observing,

34
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,990
feeling the invitation you have sent

35
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,800
by the opening of the door

36
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,730
and that consciousness passes through the door, crossing the threshold into your reality

37
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,300
still hovering in the sky

38
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,270
observing you all and awaiting the signals,

39
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,540
receiving the signals the vibrations, the frequencies

40
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:56,850
of your inner being

41
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,850
letting those frequencies

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,230
Wash over and through the other consciousness,

43
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,290
taking it in absorbing,

44
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,210
feeling it,

45
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,860
reading it

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,810
and then

47
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,980
silently at first and then as a whisper,

48
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,250
speaking to you,

49
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,010
casting spells of energy, in the language of light

50
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:43,860
that crystallize in your consciousness as symbols, images, feelings, translations, ideas, imaginations.

51
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,420
uncharted territories unfold in the map of your mind

52
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,950
as the stars across the sky.

53
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,000
Connect in your imagination, two lines of

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,770
Light, forming asterism constellation

55
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:14,820
that allow you to chart a course not only upon your planet, but through the cosmos.

56
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,140
To rise upward,

57
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:28,860
whether standing, sitting or lying down to rise up or to meet, the consciousness that descends towards you

58
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,620
and to feel your heart open

59
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,480
as its heart opens to you,

60
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,820
and to meet,

61
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,360
in the middle, in the sky,

62
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,290
in the stars in the clouds in the night,

63
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,840
under the light of the moon

64
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,180
that illuminates not only the landscape around you,

65
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,970
but the soul within you

66
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:08,550
The mind within you, the spirit within you, illuminates every cell of your being

67
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,060
and calls forth

68
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,190
the true self.

69
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,000
We're not it says,

70
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:24,210
For we are your family. We are those parts of yourself

71
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,910
that you do not yet know, but will come

72
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,270
to understand, will come

73
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,430
together when

74
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,630
will come to know deeply

75
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,740
and the more deeply you know yourself, the more deeply you will know us.

76
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,890
For we are but mirrors

77
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,080
and in us is reflected

78
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,450
the grace

79
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,000
and potential

80
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,030
You're being

81
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,790
dance with us now among the star.

82
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:15,630
Be open in your vision and your senses to go beyond

83
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:26,460
what you normally conceive of as your reality, to drop the veils and the barriers and see coming forth

84
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:32,010
a spread of lights, a spread of stars

85
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:36,570
that are not stars, but beings of consciousness.

86
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:47,130
And though the stars themselves also have their own form and expression of consciousness,

87
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,510
these come to you as extensions as sparks of light and life.

88
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,000
And as you meet them and as you match them,

89
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,050
The spark within you ignites

90
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,300
and shall forevermore burn bright

91
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,980
and shall forevermore be within.

92
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,990
As a light in the lantern that lights your way that lights your path.

93
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,390
The path that is you

94
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,490
be open on this night, under the hunter's moon.

95
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,470
For what you are hunting for is yourself.

96
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,730
What you seek is more of you.

97
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:44,970
It is not game that you hunt, but knowledge of the game that you play

98
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,830
on her

99
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:52,500
knowledge of the scene you have chosen to explore.

100
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:57,990
Under the hunter's moon all can be revealed

101
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:08,340
You can find your place upon the earth in the grand scheme of the game

102
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:30,570
and allow yourself to play out your self chosen freewill destiny. As you the unique you that is now held in the sight of other consciousnesses, other hearts, other minds other souls other spirits other beings.

103
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,440
We hold you in our hearts

104
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,250
and welcome

105
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,740
to our world

106
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,710
as you welcome us to you.

107
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:52,020
We meet here in this place at this time

108
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,950
under this moon in this light

109
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,750
This meeting shall be forever here and now.

110
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,660
So that even as you walk your path, in the light of day,

111
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,880
the hunter's moon

112
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,190
shall gleam within you, glow within you.

113
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:32,490
And Lori, you, attract you magnetize you to more of yourself, to hunt for those pieces within you that will allow you to connect,

114
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:39,780
to integrate, to join, to blend, to harmonize

115
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,150
and to constantly

116
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,460
with curiosity

117
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:54,000
burning in your heart to seek more and more and more of your being

118
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,770
and see yourself reflected

119
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,460
In the million shards

120
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,950
of the shattered mirror,

121
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,310
that is all that is.

122
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,150
That are the stars in the sky.

123
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:21,480
The mirrors that reflect the spark within each and every one of you

124
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,350
come to this place.

125
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,530
This

126
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:37,080
is the first meeting of many that shall grow

127
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,540
and crystallize

128
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,630
into physical form

129
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,690
one day

130
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,050
not too far away.

131
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,920
So be here now, in this place

132
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,970
at this time and on this day

133
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,120
of the 13th of October

134
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,280
in the ending of an old cycle and the beginning of a new

135
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:23,910
that begins with your year of 24. Within that is not only

136
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:30,750
the promise of perfect vision of a future,

137
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:40,410
but the clarity of hindsight from which you can learn to be here and now in the present.

138
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,430
Using the power of the illusion of the past and the future, to inform yourself

139
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,640
of the knowledge you need in the here and the now

140
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,320
Be at peace, be enjoy

141
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,430
and feel the beating of your hearts.

142
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,080
That the rhythm of your breath

143
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,140
as you breathe in

144
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:20,940
and out,

145
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,970
in and out

146
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,950
and journey deeper than ever before into the great mystery

147
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,290
of all that is

148
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:45,450
continue now, as your lights fade and your music fades into the night.

149
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,110
The Night of the hunter's moon

150
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,170
continue to float

151
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:59,550
and dream and be just be just real

152
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,170
Just be

153
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,320
the light

154
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,080
that surrounds you,

155
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,630
that encompasses you,

156
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,360
that unfolds

157
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:21,750
and that nurtures you and that blesses you with insight

158
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,580
that shall guide you

159
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:35,160
along the way, on your journey with us, hand in hand, heart and heart
