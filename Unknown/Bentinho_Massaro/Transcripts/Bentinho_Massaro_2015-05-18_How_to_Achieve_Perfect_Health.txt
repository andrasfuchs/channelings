Good evening before I begin with this week's topic which is how to achieve perfect health who tried the 48 hours of ease.  It's good, very different.  Yes eventually I did for things to show up or for you to become Eddie's bus all the.  Sometimes we need some counter momentum so perfect health like a lofty statement.  The thing is you never going to be more healthy than you are already so one thing to understand before we go into this topic is that you're perfectly healthy right now and if you have any illnesses or ailments that only signifies that your perfectly healthy because that means that that which is healthy, which is your garden system is actually working.  So whenever you get a little sick with is just a cold or flu, or whether it's cancer or whether it is feeling crippled or getting aches all over.  Whatever type of physical ailment occurs.  It is a sign of health is a sign that you're perfectly working in your garden system is perfectly at work.  Otherwise she would not get sick so sickness is actually a sign of perfect health.  Make sense.  So you're always going to be perfectly healthy can change that you can after that you can't take away from that.  You're always going to be perfectly healthy until you die and in your soberly healthy but thinks workable differently in terms of the physical body being here.  It will always be perfect representation of your thoughts always be perfect indication indicator of whether or not you're living in alignment with who you really are, with what you really want to be citizens are student definitions of health.  One is the never changing ever present perfect health that you can get rid of which is your indicator guidance system which lets you know whether or not your mind is in alignment with your soul so to speak.  You can change that does matter what you do and then we can talk about health in terms of how you actually feel how you physically feel whether or not you feel healthy, whether or not you look healthy, whether or not you feel vibrant or you feel that's a vibrant now all physical ailments are the result of misaligned thought pretty much do some rare exceptions, meaning that sometimes we choose certain disabilities because we know that it's going to facilitate particular lessons that we otherwise would not go in the direction of learning we not we would not move into certain directions of thought and exploring life.  If we did not include these seeming limitations in our physical makeup when we either get born physically or if we develop it over time but in general we can state that all physical ailments that all physical disease.  All physical illness or physical discomfort is in some way a reflection indicator of misaligned thinking.  What I mean by thinking I mean your way of seeing how you see life needs to be in alignment with who you are.  If how you see life is not in alignment with how life actually works how it's actually seeking from you really are, then you will start to feed this misalignment into the physical vehicle.  Mother takes a while you have some leeway in that meaning that first.  If you have a negative thought than that itself is already an indicator if you don't pay attention to the negative thought and you start to feel bad.  Real soon, emotionally speaking that is the second indicator if then you continue to not pay attention and clear up the thought then eventually it will transfer itself into the physical apparatus and that's when we have illness, disease, etc. but there's a lot that goes on that happens before that stage is reached.  So just give a little disclaimer that this is all my personal experiences on my personal opinion does all my personal view, and obviously this is not in any way medical advice nor does it counter any medical advice, but I will make a statement for my own personal point of view that every human.  Do you have is reversible.  Every physical discomfort that you have is quote unquote helical dirt is no condition.  If you're still alive if you're still conscious.  If you can still hear my voice if you can still pay attention to who you are.  There's no condition that cannot be reversed that cannot be healed.  In other words, because if you're still alive.  That means not all hope has been lost yet from the higher cells point of view, so slow, morbid, and in a way it is because the higher self is feeding you the signals is letting you know whether or not you're in of out of alignment.  Now if you cross the threshold of never paying attention anymore, but once our self recognizes that you're just too damn old in your thinking, not necessarily physically urges too damn rigid.  You're just too damn stubborn.  You're just too damn arrogant just too damn insistent upon what you think is true and how life works and what is real and what's not real that it's so so so unlikely that you'll ever get back to realizing that your the creator of your reality that you can shift your condition and at some point parcel goes well this is a waste of my consciousness.  Let's just drop dead and then the disease will increase when the cancer whatever it is or the bus will approach you at 90 miles an hour while you're stepping in front something will occur that will eliminate the waste of time that you are the waste of time that your mind has become no judgment and that is just very clear observation very clear to sermon from Marcelli go so well past the threshold.  In this particular incarnation experts at best.  The threshold of being able to listen.  So right now just a random zombie just a walking dead person.  So that's a waste to consciousness.  That's a waste of exploration it might as well take that portion of its consciousness back reabsorbed into its entirety and then from that place decide how next to express itself to learn again to wake up even more to empower Tel Aviv and worked as a mix of soul disease including death signifies either having reached or having passed the threshold of stubbornness or speak about death or simply wariness, meaning that you have extracted all that is of interest to your exploration that is available for you within this plane of probable realities.  So some point is easier to just pop out and talking about.  That's right, just as it's easier to pop out once you've explored pretty much anything that you want to explore within his realm and is not that much more that this particular plane can offer you experientially than to move onto something else again at that point to this has become innocence a waste of consciousness, which is the same as a waste of time.  His time is consciousness and consciousness is so let's say that that's not the case you're still here and are still something to explore for you.  It's still interesting for you to be here otherwise.  Obviously you'd be dead.  So, since you're still alive.  Not all hope is lost and for most of you, it's even more bright than that statement is brighter than that statement.  Your condition is more optimistic than that statement means which means that you're actually actively exploring what it's like to consciously explore more of your semen to actually be a listening ear to be a channel for your higher self.  So, since that's the case for most of you, and since that's the intention with which you came here because if you didn't, you wouldn't be here if you were somewhere in between being hopeless and being optimistic he would probably not be you're ranging from optimistic and hopeful to ecstatic blissful and excited anywhere in that range.  Most of you will probably be able to categorize himself so definitely not all hope is lost.  In fact, life is becoming more exciting to you is becoming more quote unquote hopeful, not hopeful and fearful way but hopeful in terms of there is light at the end of the tunnel of not having listened to are really having taken physical and circumstantial, and other people's words over my own inner voice not having listened and paid attention to the guidance mechanism but now I am so I'm here.  So congratulations this is exciting know that you are consciously on this path.  You also have a real shot at pretty much perfect health.  Or I could even omit pretty much it really depends on your level of alignment.  Your level of clarity.  Your level of commitment and willingness as soon as I don't pay attention to the soul of the grease that I am called to pay attention these days for a particular period of time I start to get symptoms as well.  Notice physicality responding in a certain way as well and it's always a calling for me to pay more attention to discover something else to take a new avenue in life to breach in the wall to carve a new path to think in different ways to eliminate some thoughts of doubt and lack of separation some way.  Not so much separation and lack some subtle assumptions of black that I have not seen before in that particular context will be shown to be first through negative thinking them through negative emotions and then through negative physical experiences, just as it works for you.  So when one starts to pay attention becomes one's baseline once one becomes really interested in one's overall condition one wants to feel the vibrancy of life.  Pour through their ports through port four through their cells.  They want their physicality to become also an expression of the vibrancy that life is that excitement that alignment instantly becomes very fascinating to pay attention to what you feel because the feeling for most people that's where they can catch themselves negative thinking is often too subtle to get yourself.  You have to be really vibration.  We oriented and not at all circumstantially oriented, which means that you can be thinking of your bills.  You can be thinking of the people you can be thinking of anything that you project to be out there.  You can be thinking about 10 minutes from now when you're really in a meditative state of vibrational consciousness, then you will notice negative thoughts as indicators of being vibrational.  He already out of alignment a little bit with who you really are.  But for most people.  For most of you for most of us the feeling state is where it becomes really palpable that we've not been paid attention that we've not been executing ourselves way off season we've not been taking that and pasting it onto life.  We've been taking from other people and pacing that onto life.  We've been taking from her parents and her friends but we want to take for myself and paste that onto life and not care about anyone else's opinion that care about any other ideas that are floating around.  We want to paste our true way of seeing life onto creation when we sidestepped that when we forget that.  First, we will have negative thoughts that will then very quickly start to snowball into negative emotional feelings.  Sometimes even very constrictive affective states like depression or anxiety and then if we continue to be stubborn, not paying attention, then it will transfer itself into the physical vehicle you can see if one were to theoretically pay attention to this process all the time out of excitement and joy.  I don't want to be vibrational.  He oriented instead of situationally oriented, then it is very very feasible that one achieves on the even on physical external level perfect health vibrancy, meaning that you feel amazing with your body.  As an extension of your mind, your body, mind and spirit are then truly indolent and it's a cliché sentence balance mind body spirit, but it will actually be the case if you pay attention vibration to you are and you are adamant about correcting your thinking correcting the way you see things as soon as a way of seeing something feels bad.  Your indicator is not to blame the circumstances, but to go to the root cause of feeling bad, which means a miss aligned way of seeing life a misaligned way of thinking.  The physical body is immediately the extension of your thoughts.  It is the crystallization of your mind, so the way your mind and body are already in alignment can never not be aligned your body and your mind can never not be in alignment.  The body is the physical expression of the nonphysical part or the less physical part which we call them know what can happen is that the mind, body or the body, mind is not in alignment with spirit that happens all the time and that's the sole cause for all physical suffering social cost for all forms of on health as we collect, which again is just an indicator that your health system is perfectly operational, but we collectively generally call that for or not feelings are being you're not feeling so vibrant whenever we feel bad physically sick.  It feels like a cloud is blocking something like there is a haziness that is separating the body from the spear vibrant.  It doesn't feel life doesn't feel like we can express ourselves distraction free through the physical vehicle that again is because the clout that you send the mind being misaligned in the body simply an expression.  So again, it's not that lofty of a statement to say that perfect health is within your reach within all of your reaches doesn't matter how old you are.  Doesn't matter how many thoughts you had in the past that are negative in nature.  Sure it's easier to catch yourself early on, I don't mean necessarily early on in life, but early on when you start entering a negative thought process in reverse.  And if you've already built a lot of momentum towards disease towards misalignment enemy may take a little bit more practice a little bit more time a little bit more consistency to really transfer that momentum over to the positive vibrancy spiraling energy that you can totally tap into right now, but very quickly regardless of your condition.  At present very quickly will start to see beneficial results in one folder important to realize is if you want to change any of those conditions that you might have physically that you feel are an impediment upon your joy upon your vibrancy upon your free and clear expression of your soul in physicality.  If you don't feel vibrant.  If you don't feel like you don't feel ready for every moment physically.  If you don't feel like your body is awake as well shows signs of disease is important actually do not focus on the disease because it will attract more and more and more of itself.  That's why the hosted start to develop certain illnesses then start to solidify that by calling it due to old age or while everyone around me that 6070 assault gets these elements so I must as well.  Oh, this is the start of the downward digression of the body.  None of that is true.  The body does not need to feed into a negative misaligned bodily state.  As you grow older.  That's not true at all.  We've made a true because we started to believe it is true, but believes our team.  They rule this world believes rule your expression of yourself.  The rule your physical experience.  There rule your manifestation experience.  So if you can unhook from those collective ideas and since create your own bubble reality that does not disregards the agreed-upon collective ideas about old age.  In physicality, then you can definitely live until it's no longer interesting for you to be here in absolute vibrant health that is not a myth.  People do it all the time.  There is examples of your little more rare than the examples of disease and Alzheimer's and cancer at the end of our lives, but these examples are there and if there's even one example of it.  That means that the alternative is not absolutely true.  If there's even one example of vibrant health all the way through a 100 and a need to pop out because it's no longer fun to be here if there's even one example of that.  That means that the alternative assumption that people should disintegrate in a negative way.  Physically, it means it's not true because is already proven to not be true.  Fundamentally, it's optional so you can choose the manner by which you grow old where you cannot crawl at all.  If you really believe that you don't have to as possible to lenders even examples that might be less well known.  But there's example of that to which means it's possible, which means it's true so your body again is the physical laser vision.  The crystallization of your thoughts.  You can immediately shape and reshape your body the way it looks, so it feels how healthy it is by aligning your thinking with who you are and being in the understanding that visualization or imagination, or nonphysical vibration generates the physical extension of that image now more so than ever in a way because of the acceleration should becomes easier and easier and easier to unhook from the automatic assumptions.  The more conscious you become the more vibration we responsible for your own creation.  You become the more you can choose to be in look and do whatever you want to be on the look and do like it becomes all more and more up to your preference up to your desire.  No longer do you feel that you're at the whim of some kind of pre-agreed-upon system so what happens when you get a little sick when you get a little ill he start focusing on new start tying all these ideas into it and you start thinking more and more out of alignment thoughts and you start feeling worse and worse and offer my past.  This is how it usually happens saw Bigelow to go on the throat and a nice OSHA that with best experiences.  Oh that's the sign that I'm getting sick and then I feel bad about that idea because it is not true because it's a negative idea is out of harmony with who I am is out of harmony with the knowingness of my heart self-contained that everything is possible and I can change this moment in an instant.  I can I can have it become whatever you want to become so I think all this means something I'm basically giving away my power, my ourselves disagreeing with that way of thinking.  I feel bad.  I think I feel bad because I'm actually getting sick, but I feel bad because Marcel disagrees with the thought that I'm actually getting sick and there's no way around it and then I get even more out of alignment and that translates further into the body of sexual sickness Cemex, and so you can reverses at any moment, the easier earlier you catch yourself thinking negatively, focusing negatively attracting therefore more negatively, the easier it is to reverse this process and to take the upward spiraling train of vibrancy and health and feeling really good about yourself and aligning yourself to the way you have to desist training you have to develop the ability to not be focused physically do not take your cue from the physicality.  If you get the first signs that's already an assumption that symptoms are first signs of something that's not true it's just a symptom.  In that moment, it doesn't indicate something is about to follow, but negative assumption would be that that's the first line of catching a cold.  It doesn't have to be this just a thought.  The thought will generate the reality because you're thinking about your visualizing a sick body and the body is honest of a reflection of your vibration as it is will then become optical to make sense to the more your senses are racially the more you can shift that the more rapidly you can shifted and know you're worthy of shifting it.  If you want to shifted and you can take your cue.  You can take your lesson from the first signs of getting a quote as an indicator that you've not been fooling alignment with yourself.  Now if you take the appropriate action and shift in mind shift in thinking shift and understanding yourself that the negative symptoms are an indicator of if you shift that early on and off it will not have to progress into any kind of disease, illness, sickness, cold and doesn't have to know sometimes cold is a natural part natural process.  A healthy indicator of actually shipping your skin like a snake going through transformational time and shutting everything all the negative beliefs that have become chrysalis in the body get flushed out different ways and you are in a way reborn.'s is always an indicator of negative thoughts per se, but cleansing can happen in many ways it doesn't have to go through the method of catching a cold.  Although Ken is perfectly valid way, but it can also come three drinking enough water or through you.  Having cleansing types of thoughts or taking the supplements or the herbs that resonate with you in particular that make you believe, and feel more confident about you actually being able to flush things out shed your skin in positive ways in good feeling vibrant ways and you feel better better better every time you give yourself such a permission so as soon as you focus negatively because the negative symptom arises here doing the opposite of what it's meant to do your approaching it in the opposite way that it actually wants you to operate in.  The first sign of a negative symptom want you to positively refocus yourself but what have we taught ourselves to do is to focus more negatively because were witnessing a negative symptom.  Remember two weeks ago Vanessa don't return next week.  If you don't get this one right.  A repeated briefly as to safety net of approaching all negative experiences with a positive attitude you've got a bill that safety net around your negative emotions and around your negative physical states as well.  As soon as something circumstantially, physically, emotionally or otherwise relationally pop up as seemingly a negative indicator of previous ongoing negative thinking.  The first response to that negative noticing noticing a negative moment should be one of excitement somehow go about your own way in creating this, but you have to program yourself to respond to appreciate every negative experience you notice, you become aware of with an instantaneous positive safety net response to your response team should consist of overly optimistic energies allowed is a fire.  Let's go get fired.  Rushing obviously really excited about doing what they do 02 people get killed in the fire grate, but still safe.  The rest of instead of 02 people go to the, then it won't fully won't be old to do their job.  It's very similar in your energy.  Everything needs to be seen or responded to with positive appreciative attitude.  If this is not preprogrammed in that way you will go down negative spirals and it will be harder to get back out in alignment, but you all that I practice that you because you're here told you not to return if you did not master that if you weren't there for that meeting.  For some reason he can still look it up on YouTube.  I forgot the title does anyone know what was the actual topic.  The one before that none of these basic is on YouTube somewhere mess.  Your mission easier selling to bless those of you to ask.  All right.  So next time you feel negative physical sensation.  What do you do you are excited about it.  Can you do that because when you're excited about it.  You start shifting that energy instantaneously and I got a question on..  So then what about the existing health systems whether Western or Eastern on while all that is fine and perfectly valid as a permission slip adjusting and want to give my two cents which is just my personal opinion.  Please keep doing what you do.  If it feels good, but a lot of the systems both Western and Eastern get way too far into the details of it for no other reason than from the paradigm of believing that the solution to physical ailments is physical treatment.  It is like putting a Band-Aid on a woman you're not actually treating or curing the disease you're not curing the vote you're just giving certain supplements that make one temporary temporarily believe that one is healed.  So one feels better for a while but if the permission is not powerful enough to establish a permanent believe in health and well-being.  Then the patient will be back next week or two weeks later.  This goes again for both Western and Eastern systems know when we go to the doctor because we feel not so good.  I'm not telling you not to go to the doctor.  Don't get me wrong, by all means go to the doctor, but my your attitude as you go to the doctor because whatever you look for you will find this again is simply vibrational creation.  This is how the universe works.  It attracts to you what you focus upon now even perfectly healthy people that are obsessed with getting sick and he go to the doctor repeatedly.  Eventually Debbie see I knew it I had cancer somewhere, but the cancer was not there before they started feverishly looking for at week after week, and now they are starting to look for it.  The body response because that's what you visualize this.  What you generate this.  What you attract is what you create.  That's what you're asking for your not asking for through your questions can I please have this.  Can I please have been the way that you ask the universe for creating something for you is whatever you focus upon it does not recognize the word not it does not recognize?  It does not recognize them!  All the recognizes want your presently vibrating at what you're presently focused upon.  So even if you're focused on I want to not get cancer.  I want to not get cancer.  I want to not get cancer.  The universe sees the vibration of cancer so it will respond because it's honest it's truthful, it's unconditionally loving of your focus and support in support of what you focus upon if you ask a particular question.  May I please not get cancer.  It will still respond to what you're focused upon.  So what will you find if you do this feverishly enough you will find that you get the creation of cancer and is all fine.  Cancer is a great thing you can very easily shift into body that does not have cancer.  Promise you that you can very easily shift into body that does not have cancer.  If you take the indicator as meaning that your thoughts have been out of alignment with the truth of abundance infinite creation passion you being loved you, being worthy of all that you desire.  All these fundamentally true vibrations.  If your thoughts become realigned with that, then you're absolutely learning from the presence of the cancer and if the cancer serves no further purpose.  It will leave you and you will have changed vibration, you will have learned from it a and B returned to a state of greater empowerment or greater ecstasy or greater vibrational alignment with who you actually are and in vibrational alignment.  All that can get to you all, they can come to you all that can manifest to review his wealth, well-being, happiness, joy, health vibrancy, there is no other way it is determinant is by law.  It is by the way that the universe operates with them except so I can understand the physical body.  Even the way it looks the way it acts the way it acts up sometimes is all somehow a physical representation indicator of your mind like a said mind and body are always in alignment.  The cannot be not in alignment with each other.  They can only not be in alignment with spirit, but the body cannot do anything on its own.  It's responding to the mind so whatever you think you create a body does in alignment with what you thought know what you thought might not be in alignment with what you really want to think but nevertheless the body response to how you think it's the physical extension of the mind makes it very easy, no.  Three simple health is very simple to understand is not simple to understand.  So again when we look at existing medicinal structures of whether Western or Eastern.  Many of them again micromanage and are already under the assumption that a physical ailment means something physically is out of balance.  This is never the case.  Never ever ever ever in my opinion is this ever the case a physical imbalance is always the result of the mind not being in alignment with the truth creation.  The truth of the creator truth of one's higher self, so it doesn't matter what you feed the body.  It really ultimately doesn't it can be a temporary permission slip to feel a better feel a bit more balanced, but ultimately it does not matter what you put into your body, or what you paste onto it.  It doesn't know what would happen if you drink 2 gallons of toxic material, you would probably die.  Why is that that is because you are part of your physicality at this moment is part of a collective structure.  A collective matrix.  The collective web of belief systems that your hooked into again like I said, the more conscious and responsibly become for your own creator ship your own vibration, the less you be dependent on that and you have been reports of mystics and monks being able to consume large doses of really highly toxic, unhealthy material and not have any effect whatsoever.  This is my essay that ultimately speaking it does not matter what you put into your body.  However, since we are to extend unconscious and were not all at that level of vibrational mastery of alchemy were not that adapt yet.  And because for some of us it doesn't serve for us to be so specific about everything and should be so consciously untied from the collective.  We therefore are to some extent agreeing upon the collective agreement of what happens when you just certain materials so this is where you have to balance it out for yourself and say, well, what's the path of least resistance for me is it to sit here and find every single vibratory connection.  I have to this collective agreement about how what causes disease for does not cause disease or is it easier for me to just drink a little bit more water of the less toxic materials.  What is an easier permission slip for me to go about and explore my actual theme because the sole focus of your life or the main focus of your life should be your theme of what you are here to explore what is in alignment for you and sometimes for most people it's not in alignment to completely undermine all the subconscious structures that you are a part of that help generate your physicality in a certain way so all this health systems in place to the extent that they are are for those that are the most sheetlike should I say the least appreciably conscious of who they are, the more you regain that power the more malleability you get with what how flexible your body can respond to the things you ingest and the things that you do physically is a mix and so far it's a little bit of subtle getting into seller grounds.  But does it still make sense.  Cool.  So in other words, your believe it might take.  It might require more energy and more focus, which is then taken away from you exploring your theme, which may not be in alignment for you to start to understand and believe that gravity is not real and step off the cliff and be absolutely fine 200 feet down below, it is physically possible, but what is more, the path of least resistance and what allows you to focus most on once irrelevant for your exploration of consciousness is to simply take the elevator down instead and not worry so much about the collective agreement or is it to really sit there for years until you figure out what it's like to change a gravitational field.  Either way, but one takes away focus from your life more than the other and sometimes that may be relevant if is actually in alignment for you to understand and discover what it's like and how you can alter gravitational fields how you can insert a believe that completely is so convinced of itself that it is absolutely no bubble reality from the collective that agreed to be part on part of here in its international experience.  It is possible for what's the path of least resistance and was the path of highest relevance Mrs. make sense it's a different type of example but it applies to your physical health in general.  So this is where the idea of mind what you eat comes in.  If you were completely vibrational.  He conscious it doesn't make any difference what you put in your body.  In fact, you probably wouldn't necessarily put anything in your body because you would need to however since again.  That requires its own kind of determination, focus and path to explore in full.  Is not relevant for most people.  So in general eat things that are relatively healthy for 70 to 80% of your diet at least and drink high-quality water and don't ingest too many toxins unless your belief system is already so changed and so under your conscious vibratory command that you are free from those collective agreements that are subconsciously influencing your creation all the time.  Why because you greet to be part of this collective you're a part of the collective so you can serve the collective for some it is relevant to become a testimony to become a piece of evidence of what is possible for most people it is more relevant to simply explore what is like to be part of that collective what is like to serve what is like to share love what it's like to discover more of who you are is over.  Most people it's not that relevant to really penetrate all these deeper found in subtle layers of the collective unconscious mind if you will that together generates all the things such as your breathing, such as your heartbeat, such as the gravity that you don't have to think of all the time so you can actually focus on other things, is only for a handful of people that is relevant to actually be conscious of these things and be able to change that now for more and more of us.  It will become more and more relevant to some extend to include more of those beyond the box kind of abilities and things ways of seeing ways of understanding and believe.  So far, so make sense okay and what is a belief.  This is good and feels more effortless than to dehydrate myself and focus on the dry feeling until it disappears focus on absolute not needing more but it is possible is absolutely possible.  So what you look for you will find some excess law of attraction very basic.  What you look for you will find so be careful what you're looking for because what you expect to find the careful wonderful conscious.  We conscious of what you expect to find and change what you expect to find into the things you actually want more of in your life, such as infinite abundance, infinite health, infinite vibrancy really good feeling relationships really rich experiences adventure money.  The ability to do what you want to do when you want to do it all that focus on expecting that to happen.  The very next minute for that.  Okay was $1 million and has been a vibration out of missing a ton of liking it.  One of looking for us of is already yours likely aware, is that where did I misplaced it million dollars.  Did I leave it in my cupboard to leave it in my closet to leave it underneath the table where is trying to where is the million dollars.  What do you do that, I forgot, but I know it's mine and always somewhere here.  Same applies to health.  Obviously, where is my health.  That's where it is all that's what it looks like oh yes I feel symptoms of health.  I feel more more evidence of health flow into my experience so you want to focus on the abundance in the presence of what you want without feeling that your liking you want to not focus upon the lack of what you desire, but upon the abundance and presence of what you desire one way, one powerful way to build this momentum is to acknowledge everything is going well for you set this multiple times and will see it again.  Focus upon what works for you.  Acknowledging what is going well for you.  The more you acknowledge was already going well for you.  You will amplify that and the universe will immediately start responding to reading more of it in your life.  You are completely solely responsible for what you see, perceive and experience completely how do you control creation not situationally, not circumstantially, not even financially, not relationally vibrational.  It is your only means to total world domination of your creation.  It is vibrational control you can absolutely absolutely commend your creation and is still being in alignment with love and unconditional service.  It's not conflicting with that at all.  If you understand that all the buttons that create every little piece of fireworks you see out there for right here soon as you understand that the mixer that controls what type of audio output.  What type of vibrational creation of output you perceive in your life submission or center.  That's right here.  The control panel for life is right here you stop going out of your way to try to get things any actually just over the second.  Let me feel better in this regard, I want more of a feeling of abundance and will recounts there, it appears only as I can.  I want to feel healthier.  So let me acknowledge and focus upon all the cells in my in my body that are completely continuously in alignment and working effortlessly and joyfully and in a state of ecstasy and brightness and light and love already to allow me to even seemingly move my arms like this and have a conversation and my heart is beating.  I don't think about it.  My breath is inhaling and exhaling.  Everything is going so well for me and what health appears as soon as you understand that the control panel for life for your creation is right here vibrational thoughts, feelings, beliefs, you've got the recipe for success in any regard any field of life but as soon as you go out of your way.  As soon as you get lost in situational focus and you misperceive the overlook that you created what you see in the first place that you're now reacting so heavily towards with more negativity then activates more of the negative spike on your control panel that inactivates more of a negative manifestation physically at that are on the spiral goes on until you die to become hopeless piece of wasted time or the other way around become very valuable.  Now don't misunderstand when I say that to mean that you're not essentially perfect already, regardless of how much you forgot because you are already perfectly essentially perfect as you are.  It's simply a matter of how valuable are you to the intention that set up his life to begin to understand it's never a value judgment of your core be it.  It's simply a discernment.  How relevant is this for what I want to explore.  I'm speaking from the higher selves for interview with her saloon care, but that doesn't even know death.  It sees that this is an expression of a particular intention and when you expression gains more of its autonomous freewheel during life as a grows older.  It has the ability to go off course when he goes off course to foreign Negroes to dense in that direction than ours goes hate this is not the intention I want to explore.  This is not what I want to waste my consciousness on let me die over there and rebirth myself in some way in some fashion, whether physically or non-physically within the same civilization or in another system altogether.  But whatever seems most conducive.  We set up for me to generate the thematic lessons that I want this portion of my consciousness to explore and grow into an expense from let me move into that doesn't concern itself so much with but first give y'all this leeway ago.  Kim getting a little tired of this particular portion of myself not paying attention to its overall guidance document going little more tired of it.  I still unconditionally love you but it just doesn't feel like it's aligned as much, so I give you some physical symptoms and give you physical illness that I make you paralyzed until you realize it.  And if you still don't realize it, I'll pull the plug but that's totally fine.  You see this from an eternal point of view, that's not a big deal from a timeless multidimensional point of view, that's not a big deal but it is important to you to continue to enjoy this life that should be your job and your free will up to your free choice to start to pay attention to what's in alignment for you what's relevant for you what you truly desire from yourself and when you do I guarantee you near perfect health is absolutely possible as a human being.  What is a near perfect health.  I see near perfect health because even as you progress vibrational.  He even as you become totally vibrational in control.  There will always be some type of an indicator of what you can move into next in terms of even greater alignment with spirit so the indicator of health will always be there.  Now this does not have to manifest itself physically as we know of disease to manifest itself so someone you can reach a point where you're pretty much wishes is not relevant for you anymore.  We are pretty much all the time physically perfectly healthy and vibrant and alive in the moment perspective or expression of your true perspective you're droopy but then you still learn in terms of disease or not feeling at he is vibrational only circumstantially, relationally, financially, meditative Lee spiritually doesn't matter, but you will get some kind of a signal still mentally, emotionally and physically.  If you don't pay attention that still continues to guide you into even greater ecstasy is even greater alignment into each verdict or even being a greater embodiment of spirit.  So that's why is a near perfect health all the time because of week expand the idea of health, not just the physical body, but to all of our being mentally, emotionally, physically and circumstantially and energetically, meaning that even you can even learn through the way that the board would cracks in this room when some that the sound waves that the rain produces.  You can learn from the way that the clock ticks so health is your whole environment.  At some point is no longer focal eye so much on you being the body.  Everything is your body.  After all, because everything is equally within your consciousness, your body is no more inside your consciousness that this wall so why make such a start.  This tension you can learn from everything is everything is your body and therefore everything becomes an indicator of your alignment and that's what we can call health in the broadest truest definition of health.  It is everything that you experience being an indicator of how in or out of alignment.  You are with your true perspective.  So ultimately perfect health.  Feels like vibrancy feels like spilling out into your environment feels like being enjoyed being like a kid playing with us and in a sandbox thing with the scent that's how you feel you feel no longer isolated and separated and lacking in physical and limited and dense.  You start to get such a high vibrancy level, even physically, that the physical body no longer becomes as attention, but seek I go to be or you want to its its shape to change or the way it feels.  The change in particular aspect of it.  Whatever is your desire, you can execute by visualization and looking for the abundance in the presence of it and not looking for the lack of it looking for the symptoms and the evidence to suggest since there and is getting there rather than looking for the symptoms to suggest is not getting to the mix and you continuously shave your reality again.  Everything is your body so you execute your will, all the time whether you realize it or not, whether it's conscious or unconscious, but you all the time execute your will.  Your control over your environment.  There is no other way to be experiential here you experience what you create and it's so seamless and you don't notice the difference you think you're just walking into a door in your perceiving that you actually created it right when you proceeded.  There is no difference as the perceiving and creating us the same thing.  You create your perception right now.  It doesn't take time to create something and then perceive it.  That's not a separate stream is the same string perception of the moment is the creation of that moment there is no difference in again.  Quantum signs will confirm this these days by noticing that everything is in WAV format.  Everything is a wavelength basically a possibility until consciousness decides or expects or believes that it is certain something – instantaneously it is that they to see the perception of it is the creation of it.  There is no creation aside for perception.  You cannot perceive something that already exists before you go there while it does already exist on some level, but what I'm saying is that physically, structurally, this room does not exist.  One of us are here does not we are generating this perceptually inside of consciousness.  It doesn't have a location on earth.  How can you tell all you can tell us what's here right we all tidies pieces together linearly for our mind to have this externalized experience of time and space, but really when you look at it you as a consciousness has never ever moved.  You have always been.  I am here.  You have always been.  I am here.  You've always been.  I am here that never changes everything moves through you, which means perception is creation.  Creation is perception.  There is no difference.  There is no creation apart for perception.  The only way to experience something is to perceive it.  The only way to create something is to perceive them except same is the case with your physical body that's wise possible to achieve perfect health.  It's not that unfeasible.  It's not that unrealistic.  In fact, it's very desirable and you all desire and you can all created by getting yourself in alignment quickly, rapidly, and truthfully to the best of your ability.  Every single day when you do that you will overflow with vibrancy and health.  So ideally health systems as they are present.  Can start to redesign themselves, re-create themselves to where instead of being based on the paradigm that if I see this symptom at major liking to or MSC.  This symptom it means you need some of this's instead like meddling with the physicality of it, which is not the place to work on a disease to solve the disease.  I'd love to see all these existences since beautiful and complex as they already are.  Again, Western or Eastern tunes that start approach more more their patients to clients in the following way start to map out what and to extend some Eastern philosophies have already done this, but here me out for a second what particular type of symptom tends to be the expression of what type of electric believe know if you command that out then the patient can come to you.  You can do some diagnosis without looking too much for a negative thing but just like all this is what your feeling well.  Let's look at the map.  This indicates that for approximately between 13 and 15 months you have unconsciously believed in following like believe solve elect belief met out also what the counter thoughts could be the angles out of that belief could be the angle's point of view.  The perspectives that could actually transform the feeling of believing in the negative.  Like believe Meadows outs as well as the solutions and get better after your patient and that's all you need to do no physical treatment is required map that out.  It's mappable it's not been fully done yet.  To the best of my knowledge we have mapped out a lot of the symptoms and even sort of what type of emotions they come from, but if you can actually map out and you can what type of symptoms come from what particular leg thought what particular angle of lack is about financially worrying about two days from now, or is it may be a symptom of financially worrying about three days from now on.  This can be mapped out very detailed way.  Of course it will require a lot of practice and observation of self and other cells collaboration.  But this way, the health industry at large.  Again, Western or Eastern can still go by some of its theme observations already made.  It can still draw from some of its free, make conclusions, but it will completely revamp the system from one that's actually creating more of the symptoms to one of sexually offering a solution to the symptoms them except so have fun doses are interested cool spring which the basis of what I have to say on the topic on ardor any questions specific to the idea of health and vibrational.  He creating achieving an overall state of perfect will be.  Would you want to is pretty quick.  How do negative thoughts, your negative thoughts affect other people if they agree to those thoughts that it will affect them as if they are their own if they are in a vibrational mode of observation conscious control of their own thoughts they can be offered.  Your thoughts and understand that it's not what they believe, and then it has zero effect depends upon the level of consciousness of the other person, the more sheep like the other person or the client is the more your thoughts will actually be influential in the creation of their body interested will be in the mix because again the more unconscious you are lusciously the less racially conscious.  You are the more you are hooked into the collective understanding of what how things work and if that prisons are not being enters your presence and your offering of thoughts even without speaking it.  Sometimes offering it thoughts and it is just like unconscious of all that it feels because it's a sheep like everyone else here.  Almost then it will take on these thoughts as truth because it's completely oblivious to what design requires training to be an original control of oneself and then one case free will and in everything, every negative thought that's ever offered to you, whether it's from the media from wars in Afghanistan or from like symptoms of your own body or from your health practitioner and I believe something is wrong with you all of it is seen as an offer that you can either dismiss, ignore not believe in or choose yes that's going to be mine and as soon as you do that most of us do that unconsciously, but if you do that, whether unconsciously or consciously, that becomes your reality because you agree to that particular believe and believe rule believes rulers were listed as any other questions regarding health and consciousness is give you the microphone actually can you stay there.  My first question and I believe the law of attraction here, focusing, for instance, say even 10 money USA affirmations is that a way to consciously shift from focusing negatively like a lie won't be successful in my career to same night.  Thank you universe for giving success make their allowing you to achieve that way.  Most shift your focus and the permission symbol uses the offer mission can be nosing what goes well be thought you're having it can be looking at a picture that inspires you the matter as long as your focus your vibration changes us.  You repeat the information but sugar is a couple weeks ago or a few weeks ago but often times when people use affirmations to induce the law of attraction.  A more positive way then they're actually feeling the opposite of mercy because they still believe that there liking what they want, so you say, oh thank you so much for making me so partially successful.  I don't believe that at all.  Thank you so much.  I'm so very silly dog who contracted even just thinking about it.  I remember the summer.  Thank you.  I believe I'm wealthy than what you're sending out is not what you're asking for what you're stating again the universe is not respond to words response to vibration, so if you're feeling bad when you're thinking positive thoughts your actually thinking negatively and are attracting more negative, more of the lack of what you want, so most people when they focus on what they want to actually more vibrational the painting towards it's not here yet.  I've never been able to do this before, only like 110 people can do this.  I'm not that person.  I'm not worthy of it you having all the subconscious, underlying thoughts when you say something as simple as I'm infinitely abundant and healthy.  So we have to feel it so that's why it's more helpful to do stuff you enjoy doing and not think of the thing that's so connected to lack but actually go the easier route sometimes and emphasize what is working, even has nothing to do with your money thing but if things are working for you and you can you can affirm that abundance in your life the way that life flows through you, which is also abundant, then you will actually be in a vibration that is more conducive to attracting financial wealth and then just as negative and then it will anchor that believe in more because you start to see proof and no again tonight anymore is true.  I do deserve this.  I can manifest this and then when you say to yourself I feel so financially, but Joe actually believe it attracted more sometimes is better to sidestep the actual thing that you're worried about until your vibrations in the state of greater alignment and conviction of abundance and then maybe return to the same question and observe why does it feel liking for me when I think it does and can you take that greater abundance point of view of everything that is working for you and how you are already in alignment and how you are supportive and loving thinker.  Now you are worth it to be here.  Otherwise you wouldn't be here because infinite existence does not make a mistake by putting you here when it doesn't want to hear.  In fact, it will kill you if your waste of time, so obviously you're not a lost cause.  Yet you're here because you deserve to be here because I wanted to be here because it's total alignment with your true self and your self what you desire what you truly, genuinely desire and one for yourself.  There's no difference between that and what the universe wants through you for it.  So you're absolutely worth it to receive all that you desire.  Can you bring that higher vibratory understanding with you into the thought.  Oh, but I've never created a lot of money before and and see how puny that is and see how everything can change in an instant and confirm how everything in your life has come miraculously and by surprise and not by deliberate control of the circumstance, so why not let that window open.  Even just a tiny bit in the back of your mind that anything can come your way and he started opening the window more and more and more so that actually more of the breeze of abundance can actually flow into your conscious experience so you have to be in the state that is acknowledging of everything that goes well if you wish to attract wealth, health, abundance, gratitude helps for sure.  Yes, it's a very beautiful baseline frequency is very stable and for many people, very accessible because there's always something you can be grateful for and as you start with something you're grateful for even if 99 other things you're not grateful for what you focus on what you are grateful for the net window.  Gratitude will open you up to the sky of abundance and discard abundance will cleanse your vision to see how grateful you actually are from think she thought you were not grateful for and then he really transform your life believes in two abundance points of view are in alignment with your true beings perspective of life and explore flow health of the vibrantly because your mind is in alignment with your being there for your body and your circumstances will also align themselves with the truth be this is about health on okay I am on for medications for mental health and without even knowing what the side effects were I manifested the side effects which weight gain and like decreased joint and sleeping a lot and and now ready to get off the medications.  Yeah, pretty excited, but it sounds like it's really related to what you are talking about a meeting control all those symbols that are represented not being in control, such as medicine, start to become redundant.  Gradually, the more you take responsibility for your vibration the less you will automatically physically created permission slips that represent your lack of your ability to control your body and your mind and your wealth and your well-being.  The more you become able to control your own well-being.  The less creation has to respond with things that are based in the idea of a victim of creation, and I need this thing to solve it for me so I don't have to do anything specific towards medications.  I just keep they keep align examine the more you practice to be in alignment with yourself, the more you practice to be happy.  Basically, like all right happiness overall well-being.  The more you focus on feeling good all the time.  As much as you can to the best of your ability without judging yourself when you don't.  In fact, appreciating and being excited about feeling that you don't feel happy about yourself because as I indicated at your actually doing well in your heightening your frequency enters the shadows will come up because your light is shining brighter and previously you did not see the shadow beliefs because she did not have the brightness to even cast a shadow behind those objects with now the start appear to use it.  There's a negative feeling indicating an out of alignment believe underneath it, but that's a perfect indication of your overall growth and oral expansion into greater brightness of consciousness so you take it with love and joy and appreciation to the pre-much all the time you're in at least a state of acceptance, if not a state of joy and happiness and that she continue to do that very naturally, the need for medication will disappear.  So good point.  Not that you made this specifically but I do feel that you are making a little bit is don't force yourself to not take your medication.  Don't get yourself to stop using the purchases that seem to keep you stable at the moment that they will follow way they can become physically ineffective.  They will be naturally ineffective and when you're very silly so mind at some point when you no longer needed.  You also get these very strong intuitive feeling and knowingness and conviction that you absolutely don't need it and I don't actually stop using, so work on your vibration.  Don't try to live up to the image of the perfect mystic alchemist that can control everything.  Part of their body instantaneously.  Well if I were not stated, I would not meet this.  I would not need this celeb stuff sleeping, eating, passing, drinking and taking medication because I want to be a mom.  I want to be missed.  I want to be sage.  I want to be fully realized.  Being that has penetrated all the subconscious matrix levels of this collective consciousness that is freedom so untidy him or herself from the field.  Don't force it upon yourself.  This is not realistic instead focus on one does work for you vibration.  We realign yourself more more more and you'll see that you'll need less and less physical compensation excuses for Welby physically medication as an excuse for well-being is an excuse for improving your health but is just a permission slip to some physical manifestation of believing you're not in control of your body.  The more we understand that everything is by vibration in there for you are in control of your own body and its state of health.  Then you naturally it won't be on your radar medication won't even be on your radar is a mix of rain actually shut… And you'll know it when it has shifted.  Don't force it before it has naturally shifted out of your view before you in order like I forgot to take my medicine for two days.  I felt fine I didn't even think very well do I feel I need right now.  When I pick up little tie with my body.  You know I don't even want to put it in my mouth.  Intuitively I feel like my throat locking up when I think of it home.  Great life you great sending you continuing your free from the medication.  This is one example was in many ways within which is natural transformation can show itself to you.  The key is to understand your vibration room want to master that to let the permission slips the symbols to representations that are physically created as a reflection as an indicator of your mental state of being is your energetic state of being, they will naturally change and fallaway and more transformative different things so you will naturally become an alchemist of your life you think you in the back think the pay of about two months ago started feeling sick I was getting stomach pains, lower back pain so much stuff and then about a month ago I found a lump on my testicle look that up.  Found out there all the things that I had.  There were symptoms were in line with testicular cancer, and this is before knowing that you know bad feelings yet so I know I immediately go to the worst case scenario I decided will I might as well sit with that for a minute, what's the was some risk is that I hope actually many ways is the best well and I got to the person up and I got to the point where I so then I figure by should still go to the doctor and get it checked out.  So with this was after a couple weeks of nonstop monitoring those those negative thoughts.  Nate's so I went to the doctor and benign cyst.  What did I do their other than just stop the negative thoughts was that it that is what I did is how you create your physical reality.  You see herself which trees everything through our Corporation, the record agreement through our vibrant vibratory response is not true.  It doesn't just give you limitation without having a purpose that exceeds the displeasure of limitation.  Mature said that right what I'm saying is that the purpose behind the physical inconvenience.  The potential purpose of course it needs to be utilized needs to be understood by the recipient by the lower self-consciousness, but the potential benefit that comes that lies behind the purpose behind the physical inconvenient metaphysician is always much much much greater than the actual temporary physical, inconvenient, and so when the purposes extracted from the physical inconveniences generated as an indicator of out of alignment thoughts that preceded it for a period of time when all the benefits extracted from it when all lessons are learned when you have shifted your mission to positive instead of negative through harmonious with your true being to feeling good.  Then the physical manifestation of inconvenience will also disappear because it has no purpose is not cruel subject can sit there and give you another tumor because you're being so good in alignment with yourself.  It's not cruel, it always serves the purpose when you're feeling physically ill or out of balance.  It has the purpose of showing you away reminding you to put yourself back into alignment to put your thoughts back into alignment with the higher truth of creation.  When you do when you monitor yourself with a loving attitude and get rid of the majority of your negative beliefs and replace them with the confidence of love, appreciation, abundance, freedom everything is possible, unloved, unworthy, I'm infinitely worth in fact, I'm infinitely connected to all that there is I'm stealing so good because I'm part of his orchestra of that there is research feeling of patience.  It instantaneously starts taking away the physical symptoms.  I guess I didn't at the time.  Think of it as being good happy thoughts.  It was more of.  I just.Carrie worrying about their you absolutely need to do is your natural state is happy thoughts cease.  We only need to monitor the -ones not to look for more of them.  But when you come up monitor them and decide to dismiss them to transform into transmute them to ignore them.  Whatever means you feel most appropriate in that moment to bypass order transformer to go through and then end up in the light side of the whole thing the abundant side select side of the whole idea, the more you do that, the more you'll nationally be in your natural state.  You'll reveal your simply be dusting your mirror in a way, because your natural state is already a bliss.  That's why it's not non-feasible thing to think or conceive of perfect health.  Perfect well-being.  Perfect abundance perfect vibrancy being possible for you and you still be able to learn all that you want to learn from his life in apostate matters that are negative, you can still explore and express your theme perfectly without all the negativity does mean you'll never be challenged, but it means that all the negative unnecessary symptoms very physically, emotionally, mentally, relationally, financially, they no longer have to be there for you because you learned to voraciously control the site who you are everything.  So congratulations, the great evidence of this thanks for sharing this is fun video to YouTube on this and that I think he goes to some foreign country for into this country and their suspicion on the table and nurses so a quart of ice on there or ultrasound.  The use of the think is a must for that shows on the display chose the tumor the size of the slick small tennis ball answers a couple practitioners have been preparing with a particular patient to like understand that they can create the reality and that if they say that is not there is not gonna be there and so there's is video of within approximately one minute.  There's two practitioners around her, I believe, and they're all like all three of them are cold agreeing to generate like to see the blessings like you're already healthy something along those lines, you're already clear your already for your already beautiful, you're already in harmony and you can literally within that minute.  See the tumors shrank on the screen to China, would anyone know the title of the YouTube videos gives anyone just just to YouTube search Gregg Braden healing tumor something that human cancer cancer it will show up.  It's the part of a whole documentary, but I think I also have that out to see a physicality response to your thoughts quite instantaneously is that video shows so even to believe or has to take months of healing is not trip if you get back in alignment higher self has no reason for a negative physical symptom to be there and it starts instantaneously deleting the symptom back into alignment because you are there really is no limit to what can be achieved physically even there are no physical rules not really believe rules this king of the believe is strong enough not strong enough but clear enough in alignment enough then it will naturally generate a physical reality instantaneously.  That is in alignment with those views.  This is a dream.  It's not real it's perception, not creation.  Creation does not exist.  Perception is creation.  There is no experience apart from experience, could the be experience apart from experience that is what we say when we say orders actually tree out there when no one's looking at North there's no tree other than was looking at.  There's not even out there.  There's just I am consciousness generating a perception within myself of myself in a particular configuration of appearance.  That's all that there is to creation.  There is no experience apart from experience there for her is no existence apart from experience there is no creation.  There is no universe apart from experience that means that all this is inseparable from consciousness and what are you consciousness that means that all is contained inside of your consciousness of possibilities.  The one you're seeing now is because it's relevant for you to see now it shows you something so appreciated learn from and choose insert greater joy into the.  Your desires will manifest once you realize that this is the way life operate more more quickly were more easily ease creates what you want feeling struggle creates what you don't want be more at ease, be more in joy be more in love be more in abundance at center and you will see those things effortlessly shining through your physical experience in transforming all the molecules to shape in accordance with your true vibration.  Any other questions regarding health high is what I thought our childhoods, diseases, and maybe something like childhood like a man at all say the defects in it shall responsibilities of parents responsible when you assess it with a way eventually chose responsible because of the greed of that experience from a larger point of view, so there higher consciousness.  Their overall consciousness is cortical responsible for wanting to have that experience is not responsible for something bad just be really clear as all these things are not bad their explorations are manifestations of consciousness that allows the lower self being which we call the child to like learn certain things and connect to certain aspects of itself and expand in certain directions that without that catalytic indication or inclination or incentive it would not explore it would be more likely to get lost.  So there's my explanation to the part of your question, which was why would someone already in the boom or when they come out.  Why would they manifest some kind of a physical disability, or even a mental disability or any other type of disability is precisely because the higher consciousness knows that they want to explore certain themes in it.  If they don't give this as part of the experience, then the lower self is very very likely to miss the point to not go in the direction of realizing a particular aspect of creation that wants to realize the particular quality of being, let's say unconditional love to being 16 for unconditional love and become more of it express more of it.  Sometimes it helps to have it.  His ability to be able to be totally compassionate towards other beings and not go down the route of on the most popular guy in school and talk everyone else Cemex.  It is very simple example.  But that's why some beings come in with a disability.  Now this is ability can change it can even resolve it.  So if the lessons are fully learned and the catalyst is no longer required in order for the consciousness to move in that direction autonomously is a yeah, I think save it with a witch advocate can parent help the child child three that is overstated is a lesson the land before meeting off before the disease.  Oh whatever illness clears external minds help the mind that Scott the physical ailment is one gas absolutely just teach the child personal example, but also my words and expression connection that it's not a bad thing for several there is no negative thing.  There's no problem to solve, because as soon and here's what most of these diseases are maintained even pass the lessons being learned is because then the child reaches such age of maturity.  Let's say it's now 18 years old but it did.  Gordon direction that the disease was initially meant for them to go in but now he still continues to be under the assumption that this is simply who he is and he can't change it so he has been vibrational.  He adopted the idea that this is simply who years, even those no longer relevant for him, but then the love attraction cannot bring the freedom of it to him because there's still the gathered momentum of believes that this is simply physical reality and you can change it even though it already doesn't quite need the physicality to be that limited anymore.  So in other words, what you want to give your child it has a pre-birth disability or even one that developed in the very early years, which might be an indicator of actually the child already adopting the parents misaligned perceptions or of you simply get get gathering these negative beliefs from somewhere, somehow subliminally, even at a very early age.  This can happen so that the child can already because ultimately is already responsible even at that age, there is little weird to say that but it is originally responsible, so it will adopt innocent responsible.  It is the creator of his life is to choose or see Greer to what it perceives on again innocently so, but so when the disease is not happening originally when the child is being created and will but when it starts to develop either later on in the room, which can already be indication of subliminal negative infringement from the parents on misaligned perspectives, or it can mean that the child actually wants to express itself in that way, at least for a period of time in his life, but if it develops later on in life, or even early on in life, but it's not there yet.  At birth, of course, is little hard to gauge sometimes whether where in the creation process in the boom.  This is created, but suffice it to say that either is their choice to release start out their life.  That way, not necessarily in their life that way, but usually start out their life that way so that their directive in certain particular ways of consciousness and embodying certain qualities or if developed over time whether that can already be in the mood to extend or early childhood where then suddenly the child starts to get all the symptoms is usually more often than not an indication not a pre-birth intention so much as it is indication of adopted negative beliefs that are not serving the be in that case as a parent, or is anyone in this world because you're always being an example and you're always vibration was subliminally influencing the entirety of the collective but you chose to be part of so the best thing to do is to be the original example of the fact that you can change your reality by aligning your thoughts with you really are and one of the thoughts that needs to be aligned, which is not in alignment is the thought physical reality.  Israel that's an misaligned thought.  It's not true.  So you cannot have an assumption, a big major assumption like that that physical reality is king and you just go by his loss, that is a grave misunderstanding of creation is like.  So if you have that assumption.  And yet, within the context you think all the positive thoughts.  You can you will still generate a really slow process of healing because you believe that physical reality cannot be healed.  It's physical.  It's solid.  It's a rigid it's there is has nothing to do with you is the creator of your life, not the other way around.  So those type of assumptions, contextual ideas about how reality operates.  Also in our order to fully heal conditionally that need to also be examined as a make sense and as a teacher or as a parent teachers and students simultaneously you want to simply give the example in the teaching that everything is a reflection of vibration.  There is no external reality, not really the best solution within consciousness and that vibration dictates what you'll see back is an indication and when the child understands this, especially when this is adopted an early age.  It tends to be easier to continue to believe that and to Kenny Junior to create evidence often if the child believes that believing is seeing not the other way around, then it has all the tools that it needs basically to then be the person and wanted to be with this predisposition of an illness, and that has it learns the direction that the illness and sparsity go into enters no longer any actual reason for the illness or disability to be there in order to inspire the being to become an autonomous expression of passion, self-love, infinite worthiness or whatever the quality is that the illness was helping the being inspired to going to become an embodiment of when asked no longer required because the being is develop the momentum of autonomy and it has developed strong enough connection to its true desire to explore these qualities that the illness does need to be there anymore and if it then has the knowledge that believes tree reality and believing is seeing in vibration is where it's at.  Then the disability can go in disability.  Can the but not by stating that it is a problem and oh boy I can't wait till this is gone is the near missing the point of being there consciousness was very happy for you to be there I saw was like oh boy I can't wait to be disabled, and now the Lord so goes in the parents go boy can wait for this to be over but then you're missing the whole focus on why they're not appreciating you do not an appreciative attitude your new life giver this week is your different from everyone else.  Your hassle to work with.  It's painful to you.  This is not pleasant to you of course there are indicators that that can can definitely help the child understand that, or doesn't have to live in that way and he can already ease the disabilities discomfort even while is still serving a purpose but crucial to that is the appreciation of the purpose of the disease, which is always an indicator of your misalignment or of purpose and wanted to ask for certain purposes.  It learns those lessons and if it understands that his is not in vibrational control.  Mr. C deliberately created by the way, then skies the limit and the disease can disappear in a day depending on the belief of the believe is it cannot disappear in a day that will if the believe is okay.  He is not in my healing process, but it will take three months.  That will take three months so believe rule.  This is so a teacher gets appreciation for the purpose behind certain discomforts and be let them know that there are in vibrational control and as soon as they learn those lessons and start to become originally were who they want to be that are all set to create the reality move mountains and this will become more more obvious in the next 20 years as a collective that's as possible unit X5 to six years it will become very obvious and edible cascade because and collective stars agree always second were careers of our reality to and suddenly everyone's healing all over the place is already equally as possible.  Nothing is stopping it.  Except for the believe that it cannot happen.  The sensory question.  Hey, you stand for what might be the best way to tear out at what symptoms associated with let blackberry a suggestion to store the lyrics and you you have access to all these point studies data points of information so that observation.  Obviously, just like go through as many as you can with yourself like when I feel a little bit over here.  What was the underlying thought when I feel a bit over there.  What's the underlying thought, etc. and work with others like see if they agree to that.  See if it's if it's consistent in that way, don't turn to dogma.  Always keep the focus always maintained a focus of this is about offering very flexible free-flowing solutions.  It's not about stating what you are what you have and why you have.  It is simply operating as a reflector is a map for generating greater awareness, higher consciousness of.  Why is this particularly manifesting his way home.  It might very likely be because I'm believing in this particular belief, not you.  No one has to use a map like that.  The only way the only reason a map like that would be helpful.  Is it saves you some time to eventually the map is accurate.  If the map is racially accurate and it's coming from a place of love and abundance than what it can help people with is like save them some time having to sit down and explore what could potentially be because it starts to become obvious and obvious and obvious that whenever is this particular area of the body or just particular illness.  It tends to almost always scepters always exceptions, it is almost always come from this particular believer example.  My parents don't love me what it saves you the time of having to get down to that and allows you to go more quickly to the root cause belief that causes the symptom this the only reason why this would be helpful is not required because everyone can do this on their own but it would be a timesaver for the masses.  So speak I don't really have other suggestions.  The main suggestion again is for you to trust your intuition just go with and start creating and follow your excitement and everything that you need will come to you to create that map you want to create from your particular angle on the topic of maps then are you familiar with Louise Hayes book.  You can heal your body her to that's a similar map legislator since about an officer can sing carols.  My question is just if you thought that had a how relevant or how useful that might be useful.  I don't want to look at it.  Was it thanks previous depending on is that the person is with every thing that gives oneself permission to believe that one can change once body but this is about to resist the pressure sensitive mental health like you are talking about having sometimes and just feeding into the thought that I just time for me to believe that someone with schizophrenia or something like that.  That's really out of touch with what we call reality collectively and has control over that belief and I just let your perspective on that is that they do have a choice in the believe what they believe in different types of disabilities with a mental or physical serve the consciousness and exploring a certain wave be that it otherwise could not explore always needs to be appreciated.  First, it needs to not be seen as a problem, please do not be seen, even as different just as another way for the infinite want to express itself, and they are just seeing different realities during up out of touch with reality are simply in touch with different realities while simultaneously having a portion of their consciousness be here in what we can the mix of someone wanting to hurt other people think.  I just don't think that this fear should announce there is indication their misaligned beliefs.  They believe that they like what they want to believe they can get what they want unless they deprive someone else of something, but I believe is not developed, or if it is changed, then the desire for hurting other people also disappear because you get alignment with the universal truth of creation.  You will also start to naturally become compassionate and understand why people do what they do and you will no longer feel like you're liking anything so why would you take anyone's what would you take any other portion of yourself, which is the just rest of yourself.  It's not another which you will see as your frequency increases you will see more union and as you see union it no longer makes sense for you to deprive anyone else of what they desire be life.  For example, in order to gain what you desire.  So when you see through the eyes abundances of the lack they can no longer do harm to do harm in that way helpful.  I think that they need help.  You can't because of their choice, but you can be example you can always been example was really the only way to teach us to be a works or secondary actions are secondary but example vibrational examples first, then example through actions than example, through words and teaching suggestions so you can help, but you have to you have to be the cause of that solution have to be the vibration of clarity debating whether to assess the call so that you little Scotch egg is a very so what you learn from that guide us in a two and I wonder about the process of discovering what if he went so far to see.  Not much not much terms of specific causes the Ivan.  I haven't found it clear, consistent solution other than like physically speaking, sunlight, and not eating potato chips oily, greasy stuff with essences aglow.  I've not found a consistent vibrational aspect that some actually still exploring and export this week.  More specifically, sorry forgot about it for a while but now my back.  It's pretty severe so I like wondering aggregates time for this to go.  Somehow I feel the desire for the first time ever related like none other.  Like struggle or resistances when I was a teenager in school.  It was been that but now is like and then there's the night acceptance in like not caring about it now.  Recently the last week or two to spend the genuine desire like okay well this is this is coming to an end somehow.  So let me dive into this and see what I can learn from but I'm still the process so that I don't have a specific cost for them to feel like it would be the same for a lot of people.  Whatever it is they might be, but I know this yet so it's hard to say.  It may be highly personal to me and my theme to I have a feeling it has something to do with it has something to do with the time pressure that I felt a sense of time pressure to do what I'm here to do.  Somehow I feel it's related to that but not sure exactly how may be all you know you do you think that was relationship to yourself that we get tested as first weather we learn the lesson to learn the lesson learned.  Can you define as my wife were not done some things and then it shows up again.
