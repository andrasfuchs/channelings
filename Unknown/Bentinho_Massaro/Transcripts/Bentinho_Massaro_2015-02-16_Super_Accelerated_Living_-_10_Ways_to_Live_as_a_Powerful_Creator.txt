/Testing.  That's pretty loud anyone hear me the stink has this good.  So good evening how are y'all doing so that everyone get grab one of these the handout there from you closer to the house.  This is good so super accelerated live and shut the title 10 ways to live as a powerful creator.  If you follow these guidelines and is more but epic for 10 if you follow these guidelines to see your life gets crazy to start by saying that your life gets crazy like super accelerated so for the last or so that something you want to do so in a sense I'm starting here with number 8B all in.  This is a high-stakes game, meaning that this is not this is my to work for you was work for you work for you to agree that I intend that I trying to convey it.  If you just see it as a fun thought something like even just a hobby does not love does need to be your number one passion, your passion itself you're living the way you're living your life should be a number one passion is great to have all these other passions, but if the way that you're living your life the way you're carrying your cell with you every day.  The way that you're managing your vibration.  If that is not your number one priority.  If your state of being your state of realization your state of consciousness is not your number one priority, then life will have its way with you and by seeing life will have its way with you.  I'm sadly saying that your unconsciousness will have its way with you because if you do not show that level of commitment to the way that your living everyday life then what happens is you are not in a vibratory state where you can handle the responsibility where every moment every reflection is owned as being a reflection of of your choices of your state of me and if you cannot own that every experience you have ever experienced that you run into court" is a reflection of your actions of your choice of your state of being of your vibratory response to life, then you are simply in that sense, no offense but you're not ready to take on that high state of consciousness at high state of frequency and what will take care of your life, then what would then generate your life.  It's everything that you've gathered along the way that is not yours which we call unconsciousness for the unconscious mind.  So, if we don't step in it.  We don't fulfill the role of living our lives than our unconscious mind will do it for us.  And that's what most people see in everyday life.  They see these daily reflections.  I just feel like God is punishing them more life is like a random event generator and a don't understand that they are generating these experiences, but they've given away their power to the unconscious mind precisely because they basically say the vaguely opting out of the responsibility because they don't want to be responsible for the state of being.  It's hard work in a sense it's not but in a sense it's hard work, meaning it requires some degree of dedication.  It requires commitment and requires devotion and requires desire.  If you do not have the desire for absolute joy to enter your life at all levels of your being, then you're not going to generate that you're not going to generate the state doubled and consciously Dustin allowed to consciously take her so everything is generated for you in your everyday life right now happens for a mixture of conscious and unconscious and mostly unconscious for most people assume it comes from the unconscious source for most people.  If you wish to utilize that power.  If you wish to become the power of the unconscious mind that which generates every single molecule in your experience every single second of your life then you have to step in your creator shoes in that vibratory state where you know that you are responsible for the reflections that you see nothing about wages is not about self judgment simply bowed stepping up to the fact that you desire to be master of your state of being, be master of your frequency be master of your creation and you already are.  But you're doing so from the unconscious space which is filled with things that you don't have any control over.  You don't know whether you like be thinks or not they're all happening from the unconscious, just random things you collected over the course of your life are now generating this life.  This would seem so random to so many of you, my life no longer seemed random at all.  It's a very precise it's very clear it's very obvious.  Sometimes there are?  Sometimes there are challenges, but still that make sense to me makes sense to me that there's challenges it makes sense to me that this?  Does it make sense to me that occasionally I don't immediately understand where something is generated from it still makes sense to me.  It's all part of this very streamlined, concise path, however, generated up for myself.  I generated that for myself by taking a principal such as these two duty so you want to get the desired start at one be aware of your vibration and choose yours.  Perhaps the most important.  The starting point.  Many of us again did not realize what you are sending out all the time.  Right now you're sending out something I bet you weren't aware of it.  You just think in something you're just listening to me right now what are you sending out into creation into your reality, you're a vibratory being you're a state of consciousness.  What is your state of consciousness like what does it admit what is it radiate what is it same to the owners when redefining right now what are you feeling right now please realize that that is generating a reality right now actively cannot escape this principle and we could call the law of attraction I guess.  But you can't escape the principle that 24 seven you're attracting some type of configuration of reality into your experience.  You can't stop this mechanism you can only stop this mechanism if you can stop existing and I've never found anyone who could stop existing even upon death.  So, assuming that existence is permanent and it is because it's be on time so it has to be permanent what we call permanent from the time on point of view is simply timelessness from its own point of view all the time and you exist, you are vibrating in that sense your vibrator all the time you are resonating all the time you are radiating.  So what are you vibrating what are you resonating, where you sending out right now.  Many people overlook this all the time all the time all the time.  The only thing they focus on is a reflection that they get back based on their previous state of being that they overlooked, and then you're stuck with what you're focused on is the creation, the response to your past state of being and that's what most people see all the time and that's what they define and that's what they judge and that's what they base their decisions often but you see the reflections that you get back that you trekked into your life by overlooking your vibration in the first place that is based off of your vibration in the first place.  So again it doesn't make sense to respond to what you see to even focus on what you see our societies excessively focused upon what is visible upon what is what we call reality or what is here and now what this is king.  That's the attitude, not even in Monday and every day Newtonian understanding.  But even in spiritual circles even in mindfulness circles what is his King worst mistake is to draw the worst mistake in spirituality ever what is is a reflection of what was so you focus on what is your actually in the past and you're not doing your duty not consciously anyway you are because what is happening is here focusing on the past, but you call it the present and by focusing on the past.  You keep defining what you see we keep re-creating your future now in accordance with your past and then yes you generate a loop, a time when the that keeps repeating itself keeps repeating itself keeps repeating itself ever so slightly changing as you go with and that becomes the status quo of how fast human being is supposed to change very very slow like snails with legs and arms.  No offense is just what we learn what we teach each other on a daily basis to overlook a vibratory state at the base are realities to base our vibratory state off of the reflection of our previous vibratory state which we overlooked is he so if you wish to generate a different life.  If you wish to free your consciousness up your admission up your feeling stayed up and with that change your circumstances rapidly.  If you wish to live a super accelerated life.  You have to let go of circumstances.  You have to be aware of your vibration and learn to very very consistently very constantly choose your preferred state of being, regardless of what you see.  So first up is beware what you're sending out in first place what he sending out right now.  How do you feel, what are you thinking when redefining what are you believing be aware that don't overlook what you're generating now because what you feel right now is what you're going to attract to yourself.  This just a way to call it New Age, but is just a way to number two keeps planning planting new seeds constantly with the emphasis being constantly learn to be in the nonphysical unders a couple of these are somewhat similar from slightly different angle, so I may overlap some here and there, but the ideas that you keep planting new seeds constantly.  How do you do that by living more in your imagination, then you're living in what is how terrible you say such a thing.  We are not supposed to deny what is the worst sin many people's minds to deny what is to be in imagination the worst thing you could do the stupidest thing you could on notes, not as the most exciting thing you could do it how kids live.  Just observe the child, the young child and you'll see that he lives mostly in the nonphysical what he's focusing on is the state of being is what is creating a 40 seeing in his mind's eye is not focused on the circumstances and logistics and have to somehow to he is still in the original state of consciousness which is not physically focused, which understands that the physical focus for the physical reflection is simply a natural expression of the nonphysical state that came before.  So if you are always in the imaginative state and you are always in the super accelerated way of living is you will attract to yourself to think she desired that much more rapidly than everyone around you is focused on what is there for keeps re-creating the past into the future, making it the present seem like it's the problem.  The present is always the past.  The physical present is always the past, so do not focus on what is it's not spiritual it's not enlightened is very very stupid.  Do not focus on what is you have to be focused in what you want to see you have to see only your preference.  If you learn to do this is one trick.  Many of these if you just manage one of these and you take it all the way to the T if you manage this all the wave you devote yourself completely to even one of these points or let's say two of just that some variety, you will start living a super accelerated light and things are changing and magic starts happening and suddenly before long you had so many confirmations that you know for a fact that life is a fairytale is how it works.  Ladies and gentlemen that's how it works is not real, it's not physical, not solid, it's not what is so keep planting new seeds constantly reading that right now what excites you the most.  Imagine maybe about even blocked themselves relaxing.  What do you mean I can imagine something at some point just start practicing.  This is something you get those glimpses that you hit the right spot something hits the spot you imagine something and is like a wave of bliss comes over you.  That's the state were supposed to be in all the time.  That's why work here.  That's how were created that's how we are designed children of God to be in God.  So what do you wish to focus on right now.  If at any point in time you're focused on what is and you notice your vibration a sort of mediocre or low, or even just fine.  Good nice which is already low enough, you don't want that you want nice.  You don't want good you don't even one great one.  Amazing.  You want crazy over the top blissed out excitement you want to be on fire.  You want to be alive.  That's why you were born.  That's why he chose to be here to be alive to create the extent the play to have fun and joy to over well your experience with your chosen creation your chosen theme, your chosen blueprint your chosen intention your chosen quality of consciousness.  What is your desired quality of consciousness and imagine everything that comes with everything that symbolizes that can be something as simple as a new car.  It can also be something else.  So then, seemingly spiritually inclined as a a non-dual state of being or so realization like Buddha or does it matter can be anything in my eyes.  These two things are equally as enlightened at some point you'll lose complete sense of what enlightened is if you're truly enlightened.  You have no clue what it is disappears from view.  If there are still such a thing as enlightenment here, not enlightened, so to be enlightened.  Drop all judgments troubled by us and simply know that all of life.  All of creation is equally valid so understanding that all of creation is equally valid.  What is it that you would draw the most excitement from right now if you could imagine.  Can you find something beware of reverberation.  Be aware of your state of being right now and see what you're sending out what are you sending out right now.  Are you vibrating us right now and what would you like that to become how would you like to feel instead is again remember how you feel right now is he going to attract a physical reality that represents that state of being, so you don't feel good right now you're ensuring that your future will look ugly.  So who do you want to be in control your unconscious mind or your conscious choice.  It is up to you.  It's all equally valid.  You can create a random life for the rest of your life and not know who you are not feel worthy of desiring what you desire not feeling worthy of creating what you desire.  But no, please that you came here to be worth the of creating what you desired.  That is why you're here to your soul purpose.  See can pretend to be selfless by not desiring what you desire.  We actually being very very arrogant.  By doing so Embry's desire embrace what you love and praise your passions.  Embrace what you want when you embrace it, you're into with your higher self you're actually being non-arrogant you're actually being transparent actually being free is a make sense.  So always keep planting new seats for this means also is going to monitor the germ don't monitor the germination process or in other words, don't wait so you're constantly generating new seeds of consciousness, new ideas, new imagination.  If you're constantly in the imagination factor in the imagination state, then you're automatically not waiting to see what happens to the seat you planted right before this moment.  So what often happens is that we imagine something new and excesses in an action start falling off and physical realizations or physical manifestations start showing up you start to see proven evidence of your imaginative state.  Suddenly, someone calls you up and say something about the very thing you were just think about an hour ago.  Like all would be nice if okay I got this job for you are awesome.  That's exactly what one then what happens.  For most people as they get stuck on that single thing yes I manifested something blue so they start to watch how it grows is the best way to kill your seat it's waiting.  So when things start showing up.  Don't wait for them to fully blossom create something generate something new always be in that future present which I'll get in a little bit so constantly constantly constantly plant new seeds don't stop planning new seats in the first may be hard to she can only think of one or two things that you desire, but I promise you as you take this if you start kickstart this you will reactivate more more your passion and the more you're connected.  The more you are able to carry newer, higher vibrations, the more you're able to carry the torch of the once desire to express itself in all the ways that it can and the more your body, your vehicle, your mind, your circumstances, your life, your finances, your resources, your relationships, they all start to take on a tone of being able to carry a greater flow of frequency a greater amount of abundance and greater amount of dreams can be made manifest through the being for the consciousness that we call you because you're opening up to your fashion, your opening up to your desire the mix, so more and more you do it, the more desires you generate do not be afraid of this at some point you'll learn to simply be in the state of desire all the time without filtering it through the idea that there can be lack so than the stated desire itself will fuel you right now.  You may associate the state of desire with pain with I don't have what I want with their is a gap in between here and where want to be there is a lack of who I am, but the more you embrace the idea of desire to more you get lost in the energy of desiring the energy of imagination.  The more you will start to axes greater amounts of desiring greater visions.  To come to think that you can even think of before things you never knew you would want some you start to desire these things, but it's a beautiful thing.  It's not an ugly thing it doesn't cost you suffering anymore that point should transcend the idea that they could be lack you're simply in the abundant state of desire itself.  You have mastered your state of being in the now, you can always feel good.  You can always feel satisfied whenever you want.  So which brings me 2.4 care more about how you feel that how it manifests another way people tend to drive themselves into the ground up.  It is by thinking that they desire to thing to desire more than a desire the desire itself.  The thing that they want the thing that they want the car or the realization or the community or the relationship or the finances more than they wanted the feeling state that is representative that is symbolized by these images by these notions, but his concepts by these manifestations, so over time you will learn through burning your hands every once in a while that what you truly want is to feel good and is in the senses.  I never took maturity when you realize that what you truly want us to feel good things that shifting for you very quickly then you no longer attached are no longer childlike, you're no longer needy.  You no longer projecting us much about all and you simply become very clear and very decisive and very grounded in your own self fulfillment.  You know that you are your own God.  You are your own chooser and you can master your state of being at any given moment.  It's up to you.  You have free will.  You have choice when you realize that what you're after is the feeling state not the circumstance.  Not the manifestation manifestations.  Great is awesome, but it's all serving as evidence for the fact that you are awesome every manifestation that happens is simply confirming your epic ability to create your reality.  It's not about then locking yourself in or tying yourself or attaching yourself to that thingy generated.  It's only there is proof a little and not just a little encouragement reminding you proving to you, yes you are the creator of your reality.  Now what do you want to generate next.  What do you want to generate next to what end you might ask, does and it is just end up as an endless cycle of desire and frustration and greed.  No, there's nothing more beautiful than to be in a state of pure desire where you know that you are connected to all that is where you know that you're infinitely powerful, infinitely abundant that state itself becomes your home that state itself becomes your freedom becomes your liberation becomes your source of power and well-being and ability to manifest the things you desire quickly quickly quickly super accelerated with them except five constantly be in the future presence, state, or the nonphysical focus again.  The word constantly for one inspiring you that you constantly desire to be aware of what you're sending out until you reach a point where you have this super satisfactory level now that you stop at that point, you keep going.  Always.  But until at least you reach a satisfactory state where your life is no longer generated randomly but consciously constantly be in the future present state or the nonphysical focus what his future presence when you set the present is the past.  So then what is the presence of the future.  How does that work when you're in the future with your consciousness.  In other words, when you're generating a state of being that you enjoy utilizing images that does not the don't seem to be here to become very present to the nature of consciousness you become very present to the fact that you exist right here right now.  You become very present to being alive your vibratory state becomes very conscious, which is presence so to be in the future, generates more presence than to be in the present which is based on the past.  The mix in other words, if you don't fully believe this simply ask yourself when do I feel more alive and joyful when I'm in the management of the state of imagining something I'm absolutely excited about or when I'm focused on my finances as just one example.  What creates a better feeling state what makes you feel more present to yourself to the fact that you exist at your life and that your vehicle for the creator through express itself.  When do you feel more aligned more connected when you're in the imaginative state which other people have come to call future or unreal or the real state which her parents adore when you do that because then they feel somewhat save that you're taking care of your life, which state feels more enjoyable, more life the degree of joy is exactly proportionate to degree of presence that you have not moment the more joyful you are, the more naturally quoted quote present you are to the fact that you exist to the fact that you're inseparable from existence to make sense.  So be in the state of future presence to not be in the present, future presence.  The present is a debt and present you that present is it ends killed in its death presence presence present presence future presence future imagination realists realistic get it flow and listen to infinity.  That is the presence so again this this is another way of saying keep finding new C's constantly is you could sort of forgot.  On my side later like I should about it.  Maybe that word but to number two.  Keep planting your seats constantly.  You could add be in the state of imagination or just the word imagination.  That's what comes with imagination is 99 for 8.9 and 99% of your being to dismiss 95.99% of your being is a recipe for unhappiness to reembrace that portion of your consciousness is equally fellow valid existent portion of who you truly are and start utilizing a very powerful tool is a recipe for happiness for joy for expression for creation.  So, number five constantly being the future presence dated or the nonphysical focus is another way of saying the same thing be planting new seats being imaginative state.  Don't get stuck on the physical focus cassette has nothing to tell you except that you create your reality if you don't like what you see is also informing you that you overlooked what you were vibrating previously, the make sense if you do like what you see.  It's a little nudge.  Hey, great job yesterday being in a good feeling state.  Amazing.  Good job, keep doing it again okay thank you instead of going only a nice let me hold onto this take it and leave it, take it and leave it.  This is what the high-stakes game.  It requires that you keep on moving.  It requires that you keep on imagining that you are always ready to be in the nonphysical state of creating the next moment using the imaginative state that you desire that feels good, number six.  Trust your higher self or however you want to call you can call it life you can call it God you can call up higher mind.  You can call the nonphysical mind or nonphysical consciousness: the universe is a matter of trust the great yourself.  Trust your higher self meaning.  Let go of how and when things should manifest again.  If you notice that there's attention regarding how through what means and what constricted little way through what little pattern that you concocted the existence or when something should manifest as proof that you are creating a reality.  You are not maturing you're not allowing yourself to mature in terms of number four more about how you feel than how it manifests Cemex so if you notice that tension or attachment to a future outcome.  Remember that ideally what you truly want is to feel good.  What you truly want us to Phuket and I know that when it comes to seemingly big manifestations that we've always associated happiness to and freedom to is very hard to make that choice for the feeling state instead of to go for the manifestation.  Let's say you are offered $20 million for many people, that is a trigger to become attached to the manifestation even though it all it's saying is like good job number one.  Good job.  Continued good job now expand even more, but it will offer $20 million and you need to take a $20 million.  We can feel good you probably take a $20 right which is fine is so good I would do the same thing because I already not a feel-good, so I'll take the 20 minutes but my point being that you have to choose one over the other, which one would you choose, you can either have $21 for the rest of you I've always come in in the middle much you spend.  You always have $29 in a bank or you always feel good which one would be, why do you want a $20 million.  So it's obvious we all know this.  We all know that it's not in the manifestation of everyone's being taught that cheesy bumper stickers, but there's very few of us was who have actually gained the clarity and maturity to with no offense again no judgment to know to really prioritize their state of being.  And here's the thing.  If you really prioritize how you feel your focus is the shift naturally automatically from the physical to the nonphysical from the waters to the future presence and then very effortlessly.  You start to generate all the things you've always desired, but you resisted by having such a tense grasp on the physical such a tight association of happiness with the main term of the manifestation.  So learn the maturity learned wisdom of really appreciating being a really grateful for the moments when you feel really really good and just let that fill you up.  Let that be your freedom.  Let that be the confirmation that your being successful vibrational energetically, spiritually, consciously feeling good is always the highest number seven focus on what works and what has worked so often times like this soon as you notice physical reality, which is hard sometimes not to notice physical reality in the survey to notice it, but that should be all that you do notice it.  Take note, but don't linger.  Many people linger on their physical manifestation and get in get too deeply into what does not work to get to deeply focus on what does not work and when we focus too much on what does not work, we completely tighten up our vibration.  We completely densify our vibration.  We become solid.  Again, we become linearly become limited.  We feel separately feel like were lacking.  We feel like were not an infant creature.  So focus on what works and what has worked as soon as you shift your attention on what is working and what has worked for you past you start a notice in immediate shift in your aeration and your frequency state in your feeling state if you more extended you feel you have an intuitive exes to everything that you need to have access to any moment at any moment.  You are again prioritizing your feelings over anything else.  And this will then generate.  This will speed up the acceleration of this manifestation game of creation number eight to be all in.  This is a high-stakes game.  Again, this is not for the faint of heart.  You will run into you believes, as you keep moving as you keep expanding she could be celery you will run into your negative beliefs.  You will run into your limiting believes he will expose them to yourself.  They will come up to the service does a good thing as your accelerating you will bring to the service more of those ideas that you sort of hit or that don't make themselves as known when you're in a mediocre state of being there.  Notice that when you're really getting excited and thinks that accelerated then this thought comes up more prominently like this idea all know I can do all my gamble would happen if I continue these things are meant to be brought to the service is your accelerated state of being that forces them to the service.  This is not a reality.  This is an invitation asking you do you still wish to hold onto his ideology wish to move on from you wish to have faith.  The rest of trust are you all and if you're all in.  You can live the super accelerated life if you not all in forget about it again.  What needs to be most important to you is not what you get and what you experience in your life but how you're living your life how you're feeling across all of as soon as you can prioritize as soon as you gain that wisdom everything starts to change and accelerate because now your source of stability is no longer your pension is no longer your money.  It's no longer your safety switch is no longer your government is no longer all the systems you have based off of your unconscious it is you.  You are now your source of well-being.  You are now your own security your state of being is now under your control.  In the most positive way possible.  You are now in complete control.  You are now master of your own being, which is what you've always been, but you've delegated for a large degree to your unconscious mind which consists again a lot of thoughts that are not originally yours that are not conscious so re-own what your yard, which is the creator and master your state of being become precise become exact become clear become desirous of being desirous of being in the state of clarity of clear desire of knowing who you are and enjoying that wavelength of passion.  The wavelength of creating the make sense nine ask what is most important to you every day.  Upon waking up when we wake up.  There is this moment before everything comes rushing back in all the random ship or we have this clear opportunity of this clean, clear slate where we can insert the intention for that day.  It sounds a little cheesy, but it works.  That's why I don't write down anything that is not work so asked was most important to you on a daily basis off on waking up to wait.  No way.  Don't wait, don't go take P first know you leave there.  Even if your bladder is about to explode and you ask yourself what is most important to me right now.  At some point you can do it while you but for the sake of practice simply in your bed suffer little bit and ask yourself what is most important to you every day like right now this day really tune into that.  How do I wish to experience this day and if you do this you will see major differences.  The difference between a bad day and a good day indeed is what is was that expression in the US to have it here to like yet.  We have like East upset about what is wrong like or something but you so what was it broke up and run for exactly what is a very apt description.  If you wake up on the wrong side of the bed.  The negative spiral the negative ideas.  The physical present focus.  If that is what rushes back in first thing that becomes your intention, then yes you can have a bad day.  If however you keep that at bay you avoid that altogether you ignore that altogether and you insert because you are God you insert the vibratory state of your choice.  The intention of your choice.  Your entire day will flow try to number 10 always feel good and confident.  This is all he needs not really this is the summary always feel good and confident.  If you can only do that and I do mean always, I do mean constantly.  I do mean consciously I do mean deliberately I do mean that you have to care about how you feel you have to care about your life always feel good and confident.  If you can manage just that I know is not always easy, but it's very simple and it is by choice.  You can try it and you become better at it very rapidly.  Depending on the level of your desire to actually feel good rather than have thinks you want.  If your priority of your maturity is to a degree where you want to feel good no matter what number what thought suggest to you no matter what physical present reality suggests even if you just want to feel good and you wake up like this and he said that intention and you are in the nonphysical imaginative seat of consciousness and you're always creating the next moment and your never lingering in the present.  You never monitoring how your past seeds are germinating.  Let me wait here.  What did I create overly come about when not come about that is waiting is a waste of energy it makes you spiral downward instead of continue to expend again super accelerated living requires you to be all in to be all in means that the only priority is to always manage your state of being sounds negative but is very positive.  Once you get the hang of this.  There is no going back and you see that you generate your state of being all the time you see that your your circumstances are in immediate reflection of that and hooray you live in a collective timeline where we are giving ourselves as a collector's pieces more permission to become more slippery to become faster to have less of a gap between state of being in manifestation.  Some of my days recently have been insane like insane insane insane and I wish the same for you.  There is no going back.  Once you taste this you forget all about spirituality.  You forget all about non-duality.  You forget all about self-realization.  You forget all about anything or you know is that you are God, and that you are creating and that you are endless and that you are one with all that is in that you have access to infinite abundance and that you are living your passionate you are infinitely worse of being you in whatever way you desire to be you and integrity comes natural comes effort, but in a very free rebellious sort of way.  At times, depending on how stuck other people intend to be with themselves, but you have a high high degree of clarity and integrity and love for other people naturally because your overflowing but you're not being fooled by any of their stories of lack is a difference.  Integrity does not mean you understand what it does mean in a sense you understand people but it doesn't mean you agree to the statements of lack or you can do this.  This is way to awesome awesome user.  You are free you are interested, we are very annoying to many people because they can grasp you to can anchor you to the floor.  They can bring you down to the level of lack integrity and compassion does not mean that you go down the rabbit hole and very much so means that you stay true to the example that you are by being in the vibratory state you desire does mean you go kill people or rape people and kidnap people and get whatever you want from other people does mean you deprive others of what they desire in order to please your your pleasantries as I call these sort of lower state ones that are just excuses for not being in bliss already by choice.  So it's not about getting your pleasantries from someone else, or depriving someone of it simply about maintaining your own frequency to such a degree where your overflowing in your confident too annoying degrees very lovingly so very lovingly so free skillfully so, but sometimes very annoying, but the circuit does good, that's what you want, the more annoying you are in a sense, again, of course, just out of ground is out of alignment your naturally automatically annoying you not trying to be annoying.  You're simply being yourself to that invoice.  A lot of people consider not allowing themselves to be them so.  So I should do the more annoying you are in a sense, the more free you are the more you are actually in alignment with who you truly are and you're actually you're actually giving off the contrasted and that they need to match that vibration within themselves.  So you're a healer.  The more annoying you are, the better of the healer you are.  If you are a very very pleasant healer you not a very good healer.  You have to be a little annoying and talk about every day healing.  I'm not talk about the case you come for session up of my hands on you go back home and you feel better.  I'm talking about the healing that is the example of healing healing.  True healing is to be completely in alignment with yourself to the point where you can always choose to be in bliss regardless of circumstances and that is what you meant.  That's what you radiate and that is what you radiate that high-frequency vibration will bump into lower frequency vibrations, for whom it is relevant to step into your field and be not that is good.  The annoyance is one of the symptoms of your vibration showing them what is possible.  The result is annoyance for a little while until they realize they can do that too.  And then they become annoying to but not to you to become your best friend is your vibratory match and now your co-creating and now you're starting a company together.  Whatever you do so without works with yourself always feel good and confident with any questions or statements Limited yeah I can all know a lot of it is nonphysical and inoffensive beyond my ability to really explain or share in bursa make sense Solera justice vibratory stuff like expansions and bliss and all that but every physical level, yes I can say that within a time span of six days, I've gone from one reality, meaning home living a million-dollar house being a certain amount of rent to him suddenly having an idea to move back in with some my crewmates and of justice very spontaneous random thought came up for us to move to move back in together and we said let's get a mention to you.  Let's get a mention and even two days later we see the place we stock to the to the to the realtor and all that and I were actually going to save 12 K a year by moving into 4 1/2 million dollar and I've been desiring and feeling excited about getting a Tesla so the very same day that were moving into getting all these things done and there's a few other things that simultaneously our occurrences is like this.  This intersection moment.  I always have this intersection moments where everything starts to change rapidly and as we drive out of the driveway, which is pretty secluded right now there is this reticence exactly the model that are ordered that as we move out of it.  It comes into this lane and then we parked next to the house were having a nice meeting creating run the space of imagination and endless an infinite abundance and we go back to our car and is at the far right next to our car.  Then we move on to the next place and I park some rest about a car and opposite of me there's a Tesla and I saw 5 T the day and are pretty rare.  This is one example.  But everything like little details like like furniture and communication being called by by by banks to be offered turn things on everything just conspires in a single day to make everything happen and then the very next day look back upon your life.  Everything is changed and the day before that you had no clue rates of this.  This happens more morning daily basis and you're in a constant state of bliss and you get constant confirmation constant prove that the sky's the limit and that many people get stuck.  Also, this is something I'd like to share when it comes to super accelerated living a lot of people deal with the issues of lack of means like of means to do what you wish to do or to create what you wish to create.  We feel stuck based on the circumstances that we focus upon.  This is all based on the fact that you believe that there's only one physical reality and that there's only X amount of things inside of that reality, forgetting that there's infinite parallel realities and whatever you your desire already exists.  You can steal it from anyone you can give it to anyone you can only experience the reality that you're generating that you're at a vibrational match to infinite abundance.  Many people a few very guilty when it comes to money when it comes to creating it comes to wanting what they desire because automatically based on their erroneous might I add view of reality they think well, the more I get the less someone else gets.  Nothing is further from the truth.  The more you get the more everyone else gets the more you're able to get the more you're able to share.  People are very which I say let's just call it ironic to be arrogantly ironic at school when they wish to save the world when they wish to be selfless people are very ironic when you wish to be selfless is what they do, how they think they can be selfless enough service is by depriving themselves of the things they desire is the worst thing you can do for mankind.  It reinforces the idea that like his existent and that we have to keep generating lack of the collective.  It keeps reinforcing the image and other people that they should also do that and that as soon as they stand out above the crowd.  We judge them out.  How dare you be happy over a second and you want them to be happy.  That's why you're not happy is that we are helping them be happy with and are happy and you're not happy about them being happy because they should be serving other people by being unhappy.  This is a very erroneous mind loop that many people are caught in unconsciously, unknowingly, they don't understand the irony did don't see how erroneous these ideas are you have to rise above the crowd.  You have to create reality you desire.  In fact, that's the only thing you can do.  That's why you're here.  You have been generating as abundantly as I have the reality that you've created for yourself, whatever that may be if you living in a tent which is not less than four and have made our house and the thing that under sing of your living intent and you don't like to live and attend but you do so out of believing that you should be living in a tent because as the most eco-friendly way.  Love or is the most selfless way to give an example to other people that we should go back to nature.  If this is all genuine for you.  If this is all exciting to you.  That's actually perfect.  You see, then you doing exactly what I'm doing in a different way, what is exciting to me is to show the world that there is no event that a 26.  You can live in a four and have mortal house just as one statement I made many statements.  I'm not doing this to prove anything.  But this is my natural thing.  This is my natural flow to live large to live big to live adventurers to not be afraid to find the loopholes in the system that are legal but just loopholes meaning to be creative to have access to creativity and to pay less for something that's worth way more just as examples of how stuck we are in believing we have to wait for the means keep planting new seats constantly.  Don't watch them germinate.  That's what I'm doing so as this house either comes about when it comes not not fully comes about doesn't matter where I'm at.  What I'm creating is the very next thing that excites me.  That's what I'm in and naturally the trail that I leave behind as the trail of manifestation.  The law of attraction will put that trail behind me.  I do not have to worry about the house and the winds of the trail because what I prioritize is feeling good.  I feel so much better when I feel good that when I have what I think I want, but not feel good.  The more you notice this, the more you learn to simply matter with them gaining wisdom through contrast through bumping into your experience over and over again until you know I want to feel good and when I feel good I just got everything to the desires so quickly, so effortlessly and in even better ways than I imagine it being possible.  According to physical reality is that answer question so super chilly living means that you're always in the future present the always free you're always generating what you desire.  You never feeling guilty and if you do you recognize as a limiting belief and you move on.  You recognize that you are inseparable from creation and you can generate whatever you want and there's no guilt there is enough for everyone.  You can generate exactly what you want, and by generating exactly what you want.  You are able to give that much more of who you truly are and the other thing is you say about that is, again, people are waiting for their means in order to make your life happen to every much focused on what they have.  If you focus on what you have your state of being reflects what you have which is limitation to extend what will you tracked in the future or what you have which is limitation to an extent, so you wish to have limitation to a lesser extent, you have to be more imaginative.  You have to realize that you can generate whatever you want and you have to been feeling stayed of absolute certainty that anything can happen and that you are simply meant to generate happiness for yourself and others.  As a result is a natural byproduct.  Don't don't go by the system.  If you are caught in the ideas of logic and reasoning in linear reality and you're not open to things coming your way and unpredictable surprising nonlinear nonphysical nongovernmental ways are also based on the government or government, as does the government will do those old take her me ill save my money until I'm old enough and then I'll get it back.  Don't depend on the system you generate your own system you're meant to be her own government.  Your own God you're meant to be her own level of support to the government would not exist if we were not lame okay, you're only were all lame or very lame, very lazy vibrational beings and we don't take up the responsibility of creating our own life.  It's an immediate physical manifestation.  The government though the government is so much power over us is an immediate physical reflection of us saying no thank you I want to care myself.  I don't want to live my life.  I don't believe I can do the things I wanted to I'm not worth the you all do it for me so that I can see you back on television.  Pretend it's real and blame you for everything that goes wrong in my life right just one form of manifesting your reality very powerful.  Good job.  You can switch it around though.  You can realize that you are meant to be your own governmental system.  Your life can be in your own hands.  You can live on an island literally and metaphorically energetically.  You can live on an island were will ever enter or no government will ever enter or no one will ever know about you because they don't have to because you living free in your creating your own reality you're supporting yourself you're your own support system, you're your own government.  You rely on your vibrational happiness or happiness.  Whatever.  Yes, all with that yes with that.  Like how skilled you are something.  Yes, exactly.  Thank you so you you are you rely on your own mastery.  Basically, since you learn to take a real vibration.  The manifestation will show this to you and you won't be giving away that do random ideas and so also as a side note to that does so many creative ways to quote unquote get what you want or desire to manifest that without having to wait for the traditional means to get it.  But again you have to be willing to be fearless.  You have to be willing to take risk to be all and is a high-stakes game have to be willing to go all in every single day and if you do you will be rewarded you will win the lottery, he will get what you desire because you're not holding back energetically because you are not relying on an external system on your unconsciousness.  In other words, you're lying on your consciousness.  You say I can handle this.  I can consciously choose to feel good.  Of course, on or wherever you're at.  Don't overstep your boundaries, but do try to overstep your boundaries and see how far you can get away with it until you start in the sentence collapse are really doubt yourself and then you take a step back.  You recently you observe.  You take some time you take a shower you know stuff creating as intensely for a while you don't live as super accelerated for a few days and you take a step back and you relax and you observe all that happened and only came up for you and your subtle belief systems and you start on mixing your frequencies and making them even more precise.  Even more conscious even more godlike even more powerful your more joyful even more self-sufficient.  So fulfilling and then step it up a notch.  Once again, and you follow these guidelines.  The Stanley and your life will become an insane reflection that other people will be baffled if they see one.  The year later to like you do is going on in Europe, a bank and a friend.  I came in to my present house and he sent, permits key move got going on as good as a good example.  People start seeing what is possible for themselves because if you can do it they can do.  They may not immediately believe that depending on how ready they are, but he view exude that you can do it than what were you showing that they can do it either and a missing that you need to create your life in some kind of epic manifest way.  No you don't.  You don't all is just a natural byproduct on a certain to certain degree, depending on how relevant that is for your theme.  For mine right now just feels very relevant to expanded a particular way as well as a byproduct, but I'm not full by it.  I'm not sidetracked by it.  I'm not materialistically focused as a soon as one gets materialistic.  We focused on loses touch with one's nonphysical nature, which is where the abundance comes from.  So literally what I'm looking at when I'm seeing the manifestation happen so quickly for me and in such seemingly nonlogical non-linear ways.  I see the effortless manifestation of where I'm holding my variation, my center of alignment, but I'm staying here, even as I'm witnessing doesn't mean I don't get excited or don't every yeller like have but even when I do that I just I feel that I am my environment enters no separation so I'm not going to go all I am dependent on this physical matter.  This piece of brick this amazing set of bricks with this amazing view somehow determines my happiness.  My vibratory state is in a soon as it brings the ground or I loose it for whatever reason I lose my liberation along with it as soon as you get too attached to the physical manifestation your higher self is smart enough to take it away from because it's teaching you how to be a vibrational master, not how to hold onto brick and cement is teaching how to be free once you get how to be free once you understand that what you truly want us to feel good and then the manifestation will happen right in front of your eyes and you look at it and you'll engage with it and usually happy about it and you feel at one with it and you feel love through it and you feel absolutely free from it's never yours even know you own it and even know you feel like you own it.  Like vibrational.  He it's actually your creation and that sent you own it, but you don't hold onto it because what you truly own is infinite abundance infinite means infinite possibilities and that is way more exciting of a manifestation than just one aspect of it in physical for the make sense.  So this is the way you can live both attached and unattached free not attached on attachment, but naturally unattached because what you're really attached to is your vibratory state your alignment any of the questions are so good with the mic terms of the audience.  Any questions are no I cannot I cannot cash out a brief trajectory of my life so far because it's very multidimensional.  It's very is very timeless is very parallel and it becomes harder and harder for me to to see from a linear point of view.  So I am God.  So are you anything is possible that I could tell a physical story of how a group or something, but that seems so uninteresting and so unreal, so not me anymore.  But okay.  Briefly I grew up in Amsterdam in Holland.  I'm 26 years old right now scrub with divorce and parents and at the age of 16 I got a really strong desire to find out who I am and was the source of life and what is possible.  So I read a ton of books I went to India for half a year.  Set with teachers and swami's son meditated, rebelled and absorbed and extracted and transcended and left a lot behind me and very rapidly.  I started to gain real clarity as to how reality works who I am.  What is true with untrue what is permanent was not permanent and through that process of I guess you could call it enlightenment.  There's a realization I came to I was always always had the teacher and recite naturally shared whatever I knew at that point, and that just simply developed and started doing some YouTube videos sensor being invited to the United States to to share this message with people back in the day it was more traditionally, nonviolently or more more regarding recognizing the change looseness of the presence or the awareness that we are home and does develop my teachings change many times over the past say five years that's the many like six significant changes at least at some point I felt I've always had this idea for creating Academy like an online Academy where everything can be sequential step-by-step so that all that I know can be brought down to very simple step-by-step terms for the masses.  So that's I felt the ready to do that by careful that my teachings reached a level of readiness or completion and a sense of wholeness where I could do that without two years later, necessarily feeling like all this is a really terrible thing or terrible teaching so I'm sure I'll see some changes and I'll make some change along the way but the whole picture is complete enough to where I can say right now that even though my teachings keep refining and evolving is a is a very holistic system for everyone.  The average Joe to just go through step by step, so I started creating about half year ago and now I'm here under so much I didn't tell you but that's right.  I don't know what else to do if you have any specific questions.  I'm always I'm always open to answering anything about my personal life, so feel free to ask a specific issue want to.  It's about relationships was about money workers about all whatever doesn't matter if it's a longer question please that you elicit a peer or just got the microphone and said there hello come across use in November in yes and I was in at a state and someone told me about you and I watch one of your videos and I was just very quickly hooked and I went to a lot of energetic flowing and I was taking.  I have all these notes continues to stall these questions and it was great.  I say was for reason.  I mean it's getting so parallel realities in trying to understanding your concept of the world and reality and agreed across was somebody was wonderful because you are me and I love you and I want to serve you.  I wanted to do well by you and it was wonderful.  Then two days ago something took me out and I know what it is but I have come back to me very familiar anxiety.  It feels like attention right here.  I do things to get away from it.  My drink take pill painkillers and it doesn't really feel good to do that anymore, but it also does feel good to feel this feeling and I was watching another video this morning where it's you.  You've got to so much transformation.  It's kind of amazing but you look quite young.  In this video and I thought I I came to an awareness that I have a belief that I'm unworthy, which is something you speak about a lot, and I kind of broke down and what does it felt like that's where I was so unlike here I am now.  I still have the tension right here and I don't how to get under it.  Okay not to get under it because I don't know how to embrace it fully and have it disappear.  You speak of the blissful prison and I do want to feel good.  I don't know if my desire for whatever I want is very strong in this moment, but I do want to feel good and find my piece so what are you believing that your spirit disagrees with his ex-wife about that.  I can't possibly understand it further.  If this is what it is old.  Yeah, I see that it's a simple but that can't be it.  This is Annette the theater know that I must not be true but even know you know it's not true.  You still think it will serve you in some way to hold onto believing something that's not true.  How will it serve you to continue to believe that you can't understand that you can't do this we can't make this yours is it won't serve it's nuts.  It's not serving the way of any good, but you hold onto it because you believe that Serbia is no other reason to hold off any only because you think it will give you benefit or safety or security or avoid something more negative.  We all we often make ourselves feel bad in order to avoid feeling even worse is the best way to feel worse, those to feel that because then you generate more worsens that more persons.  So if you really wish to avoid feeling that you gotta simply choose to feel good no matter what the circumstances look like and what your mental capacity looks like.  Yes, even I wrote like a bomb feeling unworthy is arrogant would you say that I went you in this image is arrogant light to think of it that way yes you want me to expound the U nuclear yes so the feel unworthy as to basically state that you are not created by the creator, the feel unworthy as to say that somehow you and you alone out of trillions upon trillions upon trillions of beings of I am individuation's of the audit is conscience somehow only you managed to enter this creation from outside of creation is arrogant.  In other words, everything is worthy of being a part of creation but you somehow when you were born you.  I don't know how it happened but you came from outside of creation.  You just dropped into creation from outside of creation.  In other words, you're not a portion of existence.  In other words, existence does not desire you existence doesn't desire me that's the feeling of an worthless is the translation of I believe that existence is not desire me to be who I am.  In other words, I came from elsewhere, because why would the one existence create a portion of itself that he doesn't want to be there.  It is enough to do that could only happen if there's two beings.  It is to beings one could do something that the other disagrees with since there's only one existence.  This is going to do anything to disagrees with so you're saying existence disagrees with you, which implies that you must come from somewhere else in existence that is arrogant symptoms may not help you but maybe not.  I don't know him.  There was also a woman who had an accent any she asked you to she sell me a letter tell me why I am a part of God, and what you told her was wonderful and it got to me.  But then it left the clarity left this the yesterday experience that I was connected that I am you and I love you and I love you and I want to serve all of you left and I don't know.  I wish I could recollect.  I actually had a therapy session on Saturday and something that happened seem to undo this connection and I haven't been able to recollect what exactly that action on the new simply start to send out different message selecting laboratory state to pinpoint whether that would be helpful could you sense of what are you sending out right now actually covering over the connection.  It's always there.  You can't actually be disconnected again.  That would mean that you're not part of existence that you could connect or not connect with and who are you if not exist.  You can't escape existence always going to be got and inseparable from zero is desired, you can make a mistake you can only be yourself can only add to the expansion of the universe.  Anything you do no matter how much you talk up.  It's all expanding the universe.  It's all expressing and finishing all the ways that a cat from the infinite.  Once point of view what we call parking up is nothing but adding more layers to creation adding more ways in which you want to express itself to itself.  That's all it sees was a positive thing to mess up answers, no mistakes, you can only add to creation.  You can only serve you can only co-create.  You can only add to the clarity to consciousness, you can only add to creation.  Is no way that you could ever do something wrong.  There is no way doing something wrong is a perfectly positive manifestation of existence it's adding to the one knowing itself.  So you're always being of service by simply being you with you judge that is positive or negative is up to you but from the eyes of the one it's always possible is always adding every second.  You're adding a soft every second.  You're adding a feeling every second.  You're adding a new context.  The new relationship, a new way in which it can know itself that it hasn't known itself before into that particular so you're always positive.  You're always desired your always appreciated your presence is always adding to the expansion of the semi that make you feel more connected when you think along those lines, in part, it does and there's still I have the idea that there still believes that I'm just really holding on to find like art like I'm powerless.  Yes, great ineffective beautiful.  Does that make you feel a certain way yes is not a sign of power.  The generated file by using a thought is not power.  Yes.  So what if you have different type of thought, would you create a different type of feeling and then with that a different type of action set in a different type of reality yes sorry not powerful.  I not already creating how you feel right now and with that, everything because the feeling is a state I am creating how I'm feeling right now.  How powerful.  Yes, how would you do that if you are not a part of God.  And if you did not possess a portion of its power to create.  I have a lot of butts coming up the subject just expressing I am creating how I'm feeling in this moment, but I still have parts of my life that aren't the way I want one now.  Many things have you thought in the past that were out of alignment.  Many while they see how powerful you are.  So all these parts in your life that you don't enjoy are all proof of how powerful your is not the way that you want to be but nevertheless it's pointing to urinate power that you can't escape creating reality and is giving you clarity is giving you notification a physical location.  Lerach like the you can click on it and say okay this creation is not what you desire and you click on it and it takes you the creation and you see it and go unfriend or unlike or stop showing up in my newsfeed and then it feels good.  You learn more.  You are and how to master your vibration and I go into the search bar and you're searching for page that you would really enjoy that you haven't liked yet in other words, is not yet present.  So what are your hobbies or do you have any kind of passion don't say no.  I love to cook could say look up this amazing autonomic cooks.  It's not one of my passions, but they but I love to be cooked for them so you look at one of these cooks on Facebook and the like, wow, this is a really beautiful patient, love is in so you like it, and he added to your newsfeed and if you're really leverage even though every time she posts an update.  Give me a personification works perfectly.  That way, Facebook is such a a perfect analogy for managing your vibratory state and choosing what you prefer choosing to see only what you prefer.  For example, so do you see that the things that are present in your life are reflections of past vibratory states, and to an extent, but rations that are still lingering or that are still available to you.  I don't know you don't know if I believe you seem like random physical events that were out of your control.  Yes go so and we believe that that is the belief that reality consists of an independent physical mullet molecular structure or do you believe it's all agreements of consciousness.  I love hearing that it's a dream on side of consciousness because it's true that you feel good when you hear that yes, it must be troops yourself agrees to you.  That's what good feeling is good feeling is your highest self-is always ready to push a button.  This is red button that says no and is read the screen on the 30th whenever you have a thought that is correct ghost and you feel good and whenever you have a father feels that is because the thought is untrue eyes of all this are simple emotional body works.  That's all there is to it.  No need for psychotherapy.  Just recognize when you feel bad, it's because you're thinking something untrue when you feel great is because your lining up with the true frequency of existence of your true self.  So if I tell you that everything is agreement how to consciousness as a yes even to this smiling thing is not your dilution.  You can't be happy unless your high self agrees with what I'm saying okay yeah we trust ourselves with them or do you prefer your own brain cells linearly oriented way of seeing the world as a make a choice.  Do you wish to trust ourselves, which means trust what feels good and say, respectful, appreciative note to the things of the ore trust what you've grown up with.  From this very dense physical slice portion of creation taught by your parents who are nothing but dummies and then go no I think I am right my high consciousness which sees always infantile really simultaneously.  It sees all the parallel lives and living right now work in most people's ice is called past lives.  It sees all my future lives.  These all my alternate versions that are in my range of possibility and relativity.  But no.  I believe I am right.  So let me feel really bad because I enjoy that because I just want to be right.  Why actually taking a step of faith because there is a message is very compelling but I don't I do want to trust my higher self, but I'm not telling you what compelling is price of going green button.  The wiring needs to be improved.  The wiring wiring but it's slowly getting through is not really bad you feel instantly good.  But then you linger yes is not up to the channel.  That's up to you.  Your free will is honored, you destroy your joy dreaming.  I hesitate you hesitate.  You base your reality off of what you see physically which is only the representation of your past creations.  You only things that are to understand things you're doing the opposite not alone if that helps.  I know I know in the same and to encourage keep doing that and you're not alone.  This is this is normal is not natural but it's normal to be abnormal will be annoying you got to be free.  You gotta be wild to be revised to be adventurous, you got to be all in you care about how you feel because how you feel is coming from the highest wisdom that you have Axis II as a human brain.  The human-based physical mind has no access to consciousness higher than how do I feel in this moment that's as far as our wisdom can reach in this physical creation through that you become aware so much more and you become wiser in that sense, but this is your guidance mechanism this you always be honored above anything else that you realize this is where so many spiritual people go wrong, they take your realizations and their perspective on it and I always see you take your personality with you all the way to the realization of the absolute meaning what ever you realize you distorted whatever you realize it's still your point of view of that realization, and people start to use that idolization.  That realization and the rotation of it, and he start the value that because it seemed so wise and so approved of by gurus with long beards that say the same thing and that's a really authoritative and is a good other sodas from other marshes of those Buddha said this so therefore I'm worried and a forsaken the fact that he doesn't feel good and other things do feel good.  Desire should be suppressed as a distraction.  If you only entrance pointed to with them any real type of applicable was don't ever suppress her desire suppressed everything else but your desires and your integrity.  Your respect for other beings free will that and your desire and you're good to go ignore everything else in your good to go so so you speak with great certainty.  I don't I am not as certain as you are at this moment didn't.  I can't be a won't be beautiful.  Thank you that feel good when you leave that open and I resonate with your certainty.  I suppose some things are doing is imagine one of those record the pallets that the painters have different colors on your little he likes seeking through different colors.  Tasting will be here testing will, but that is in there and you're about to make a choice.  You are still exploring your options which is great is good and natural but you are in the process of choosing which color you wish to actually use to paint a reality with was a good you're simply exploring about your very explorative energy right now like to wear, but this was so skittish there's an open and there but just know that you're about to make a choice and feel free to keep keep tasting a little bit here and there but just know that nothing is a given.  It is up to you.  All colors are the ones creation equally.  You can choose blue you could just read you can choose positive you can choose negative pictures, depression, you can choose bless the one will only go thank you that's another way in which I can express myself.  It doesn't experience depression experience method.  It only perceives more of itself is up to you to choose what feels in alignment with your higher self, which is not the one it still has preference is to have the guidance mechanism is still guiding your theme.  It still has relevance but that should be honored because there's no way to live in the absolute.  While you're physical.  There is no way to become fully the absolute one which already are in some level from a physical cause is not relevant were not supposed to be physical because we have a purpose to otherwise who would simply not exist in a way that we do so under your feelings.  If something feels good will you learn to trust that that comes from the highs with the mu breakfast.  And if you do believe that at some point.  Ask yourself, do you really wish to negotiate with do I really wish to argue with.  If this feels good but my beliefs as well.  If I go down this path, my mom or my my spouse will no longer love me.  So let's not do that but you know that that path feel so good for so fulfilling and you know that that comes from the highest potential wisdom that only has your best interest and insight in it sees so much more than you do and let you know very easily through a good feeling.  Is it really smart to argue with.  I'm worried that I do hesitate and I do still have this tension feeling here and I'll just do with it what I do so you hesitate and then you worry about still hesitating at will.  It's just too coincident things.  One is I hesitate and that's a problem because I don't and then the other one is this feeling.  When I first awakened the morning before then you let in the first thought without consciously choosing correctly a boat within the castle changes is still fresh is no okay, that's simple to know about what is not simply the means by which you tune into an alternate realities that an alternate state of being about the thought itself.  The thought itself is like the hand that turns the dial on the radio station that turns into different frequency what you want is the other frequency.  The state of being the feeling the conviction, the realization that's what you desire thought is one means to turn a dial so you thought use imagination to imagine the things that correspond to your resident such as joy and love and laughter can joke you anything else that I cannot but anything more specific like in terms of something that really excite you and put you on a trajectory of clarity and attention.  I am not at this time.  I just know I do want to feel good good list.  That's good that specific you want to feel good.  So Rita, I can make the manufacturer good feeling or what I've been doing is remembering how great I felt like two days ago this past month when I was good.  You can use your memory, which is a thought of capacitor being to dial back into that vibratory state or very similar one.  So yes you can use memory in that way whenever you felt great.  Think back to that moment and move if you do that for certain period of time they have a minute you start to actually feel that reality once again sometime soon.  Or sometimes takes a while, depending on how much mass you are generating in between the thought but if your subcommittee clear very fury can be very instant, but you can be second of course but this is the flip effect is for most people, 30 seconds with drink so on.  So you using thought simply consciously as a means to tune into vibratory state that you enjoy right, you can always do this.  So how do you make yourself feel better by thinking things that are in alignment with the way your higher self sees reality.  The only way to feel good as a human being is to be in alignment with your thinking does things that are in alignment.  I'm getting a feel good.  Yes, automatically because then I press the green button which is often Bliss waves her way and the and I saw the limitation he can go real fast so is all dependent on how much you can receive how much bliss are you willing to receive how many exact precise abundantly oriented perspectives.  Do you wish to accumulate in your consciousness.  How precise do you wish to see existence.  How joyful.  How blissful would you like your perspective of this moment to be can go as far as you can go further, you will never run out of bliss unless you choose that it's enough.  Enough is enough.  Okay, we get used to.  I see enough of the fun I give me a break ship a little less bliss please here for Caesar playing with your frequency at some point you become more more masterful and there's no way back he cannot be fooled you become your teacher creator is a feel-good yes are you aligning your thoughts with I could say mind but let's say your higher self right now.  Yes, I'm feel better know as soon as you feel bad.  Notice the thought that you had.  You are dialing into reality that untrue only ever what about, but there's so much to the wrong thought ourselves going to dictator precise.  He did his thinking something you think of something good.  It's really simple as no negative things without work is meant to guide you when you're thinking something wrong you feel that music and something right.  You feel good Constable Louisville is no other is no different than in a teacher spanking their kids in school when I do something wrong except is actually coming from wisdom and love is such a simple system.  We've adopted it as human beings to teach your kids will do something wrong make them hurt some way to feel bad for doing the same thing as ourselves to look different.  This is a school for your NLP is good for Nancy.  Relying yes.  So what about I'm still say fear like say I have this expiration to your own is saying this like open mic at a coffee shop and saying is great for minute and like today happens like tonight like four hours and I start to feel really scared and so that I might own feeling bad.  This is a feel-good business mission to graduate and I just don't do it, and I use that as an excuse to not do it.  Can you clarify that.  Is anyone here that has to which this principle applies right now in your everyday life.  The everything that you're passionate about what you're also scared of the new start being confused to mine.  Would you mind sharing about well I'm starting to do artwork now and I'll wanted.  He recently said, I took the salon to get around to it was that I fear on some level it will work out evenly.  Even I won't enjoy it or.  I want even if money to get supplies are all kinds of stupid staff so often when I desire something.  Yeah, there's the fear in their lesson.  Last, but I relate to it, so can you see this is exciting.  Why am I just have I think yes my life.  It will wasn't OIC okay so it's exciting.  It is so nice.  Can you see that the thought that I could find is like a sampling you become so vibrational he oriented that you see every physical reflection literally as a reflection of the game is a energetic game at your playing with yourself as soon as you see it that way it already becomes way lighter and becomes a play so then you get excited.  Oh the fun thought makes me feel not so good.  And then you start navigating you start to learn how to like ease that the ease that vibration and show it that it's not true, and easily into feeling really amazing again and feeling really confident and worth the of the thing that you do decide to do and then open up your flow and literally every time you get excited about a new vision than the day to challenge comes up you, which is for example can come in terms of thinking all well what about you know I want good materials but in a flood of money and wondered that's an example of a day to challenge responding to your day.  One new vision and enter reached a three today of confirmation transformation celebration.  You need to approach day two with a playfulness coming from the day one energy I really want to do this.  I really wish to do my art no matter what.  I know somehow it's possible but now the site comes up and makes me feel like it not possible.  Makes me feel negative.  Makes me feel heavy.  If you purchase with an excitement like all fine.  I'm feeling that's a good what is it was.  I believe all that is if I buy this set of pencils which is turned $50.  I'll have to cut back somehow on my foot expense.  But I'm already like not paying so much of my food and keep doing this you will need new canvases.  Melissa then at some point I might run out of money and I need to like figure something out with my registration where I need to get a job of some kind words.  The mind goes off into its irrationality based off of being physically focused physicality will always show you limitation because is only one snapshot of infinite possibilities.  One snapshot never contains although it does energetically inside of itself but in the picture of it.  It never contains any other reality.  In other words this room does not contain China.  This room contains this room.  If you are to China will expand China.  So if you base your reality off of what is here in this room you'll never believe China is possible.  But if you simply think of China.  Then suddenly you start seeing advertisements.  Amazon is so smart it can reach her vibration at right now in place the ad on the side of the bar that says do you want to go to China you like for my what I think Amber yes they are also enough for prying to your awesome service.  I don't work for them and you on or do you hit the button and you book your flight to China.  All because you were in the spiraling upward spiraling energy of anything is possible, not base of what you see in his room.  If I say so everything off of this room just his room.  Then I'll never get out of this room right.  So, if we if we state this.  So we stayed these definitions to ourselves.  I can't do this and not worth the effort is like a half understood little means it's all based off of the physical focus in a nonphysical focus which is to Oz imagination.  There is infinite me.  Can you imagine infinite means in imagination.  Infinite money imagine infinite money imagination is a look like was a fee like infinite mind is great.  Thank you.  You offered a book they go so imagination is infinite means has nothing to do with the structure.  This carpet but who cares with the carpet.  What I enjoy the imagination of infinite money or infinite trips to China or infinite pencils to draw with or infinite artwork to sell and to enjoy it and share with people and to enjoy my own process of being in that sort of channeling into the state of like doing my artwork.  I'm really looking forward to that that is all that matters to me.  I'm going to somehow ease myself back into that vibratory state of conviction every single time.  The thought is pushed to the service because it wants to be seen and transformed.  That's what comes up now because it's a real real concern it comes up because is an unreal concern is to make sense.  The concerns come up when you increase your frequency exactly because they are on real concerns and they need to be seen because your believing in unreal things.  If you going out unreal believes you cannot increase your frequency past a certain point.  So when you go past that special everything that does not fit in with a new reality just disappears.  But if it's something that you're holding onto subconsciously than it needs to show up.  If you would hold onto any believe negative, then press a certain threshold of vibration, then you would simply go up that vibration go of the vibration and nothing, no challenge, no day to experience would come up.  The only things that are pushed perched to the service in terms of doubts which are exciting.  It's a vibrational game get excited about it again be all in.  You want this more than anything so you want the handouts to come up because what you're most interested in is not painting is not selling artwork.  It's not being worthy of showing your work what you're interested in is the way you live your life the way you feel right now so that's what's exciting when doubts come up this advice exciting when things are not happening for you the way you want them to go is exciting because what you're interested in is to see it as an opportunity to master your state of being even more so you say thank you.  I know I'm infinitely worth the infinitely abundant eventually I'll get what I want anyway so there's no rush.  There's no time pressure.  I've already got the thing I desire otherwise it would pop up in my frequency now this is a little hiatus.  This distal gap is little doubt that comes up I want to see that.I'm really excited about this doubt because I'm a vibrational being and I wish to clear up my vibration so that I can enjoy even greater degrees of wisdom, blues joy, love, service connection to the one in my everyday life, and I can manifest even more awesome thing so thank you for showing me that I have limiting ideas.  I so appreciated.  I so want this to be shown to me.  I so I'm not afraid of seeing and feeling the negative energy of the doubt temporarily because it was only temporary, and the more I look at it the more I appreciated the quicker it will dissolve and I'll easing back into the vibrational conviction that I'm infinitely worse.  He infinitely capable infinitely abundant and inseparable from all that is so thank you to the extent that a question came based on a certain energy density seeing people.  But then them as colors is regedit.  It is totally personalized in such a big aha so I'm exaggerating a little bit.  My version of what I said was I was promoted to a course leader here in the workshop facilitator workshop is the new dark" timeout like park may be low because I was writing I feel good about it so adolescent as well get energetically lazy.  Just make an assumption of this must mean I should do something professional.  My thoughts my thoughts then turned into OSHA if I cannot articulate, really good enough and asked me back to back them up in our builder pursue micro-direction.  The way that I want and as big as no one is determined the correction from herself once more.  I have the insight and on my journey to that offense still monitoring the thoughts I have those thoughts are out of alignment, bringing a lot of people, myself included, blame the events as it meaning the event associate about religion to do so.  The straight and specific about this.  Another question that comes up for this was to your personal know those you shine harder.  Almost not really sure your site is only God but that's the more specific answer the question that I see what you will see the large auction doesn't work because of a girlfriend who thinks these wishy-washy father pushing or does anything is just an idea but she just sits in the household is no way I know is not true.  There is another situation.  This is personal to him yeah because woman but I like showing it.  I think the questions exploration statements, vibrations so Leslie can set up a little bit worried about the nuclear situation all that so so just some self myself to be in charge of at least the heartedly getting rid of all nuclear weapons on the planet Earth because it's fun for me to imagine that I might actually have some influence will talk last week and all no prudent kind of calm down a little bit and things are little more peaceful there than in and I think you helped and so I stream out and and I want to keep going with that so that we can actually personally I want to experience 700 M and I have at times so I go that I get energy last week so thank you.  So my question is all gone ghostly which I think about before go to sleep.  I think I know please don't what would you say I would say I should preprogrammed the kind of dream and will have tonight was lovely.  I'm in general.  Yes you can do on your waking life what you think about the answer is always whatever feels best if you think something completely unrelated to the issue.  You think you're working on the thing you think you want to create on planet Earth or in your life if you think something completely unrelated to that event, but it gives you a great amount of joy and expansion that is going to help you manifest that creation if it's actually what's relevant for you.  It's actually desired, it might have just been a substitute desire because you didn't know any better, but if it was irrelevant, true desire.  It will come about by thinking of something completely unrelated, that brings you great sense of joy and apartment was if you think about the thing you wish to create and you think about even visualizing the positive outcome of it for many people because they put such charge an attachment to that particular outcome will still generates you you know your grades, greedy ribbon.  Maybe it's not great but I just think about the but maybe won't happen because there's always things involved.  So we send out a semi-negative vibration window are positively thinking about everything that we think we want to establish is less effective than to think about a flock hopping around the base of the great joy somehow that will figure itself out again.  Don't worry about the house and the winds of manifestation trust in your eyes ability to create United creating with your physical molecules you're generating from your high consciousness.  His ability to create this dream and the physicality you have to give that up.  You have to take on your right to be a relational cocreator and give up your right to believe that you are physically making things happen you don't you make them happen through thoughts are connecting vibration only to these parallel realities using imagination.  So think of something to bring to degrees.  So enjoy and put in will put down his arms.  The except it does believe that I think it's happening in the believe that this is how the system works.  You are precious you are you willing to ease out a little bit of your strong intention to get this thing done yeah because it's really a pain in the butt you saw my imagine the removal of all nuclear weapons from powder.  I appreciated the why wasn't my idea.  I mean really you can actually do it, but not by being not by being overly focused on is the irony he to measure vibration.  If you manage your vibratory state.  In other words, if you always feel good and confident you will shift into reality where there is no nuclear weapons and you're already in a reality where no nuclear war can never happen again.  Just so you know if you still want to clean it up you can do that but there's no actual reason to clean up our physical reason other than if it is your joy to do so.  Other than if it resonates for you to do so, then please keep doing that but the way for you to actually manifest that is to ease yourself into the state that feels truest and most passionate to I totally admire your vision and I think you should go for it and make sure you feel good way to do what you think about if it makes you really really ecstatic and charge free when you think of all nuclear weapons have been this.  If that feels truly good without like all your business happen because if you feel is about to come up in your vibration than either clean up the but see what believe is underneath it.  That's negative that does not believe in the outcome or completely think of something else that does bring you a holistic 100% blissful connection to your true self and then that will be more efficient and somehow Nancy wake up and you read his news paper that says something was put in motion better remove this one countries nuclear weapons so you're not creating physically you're generating your consciousness through vibration is really good sit here came from Josiah.this is I want to do this kind of thing with music it into people into really high states of emotion and all legal and and I want help getting the money to to do that because it seems like people pay attention when you're more confident than they do in your going around while I'm still struggling for money on it off again if you like.  Fred warned Buffett sitting here with us on we would be getting a lot more attention yeah how to success creates more success as a distributor is the perfect example of when he is only successful because he was successful in is likely successful every customer success like anything that you have something of that you are putting yourself into you generate more of a more of a more just amplifies so yes and confidence in that sense will always be king confidence in whatever is relevant for you sent letters to generate music that uplifts before to co-create music of its people to have other people generate music that uplifts them.  Whatever it is, then just go do that as confidently as you can and confidence of that in the purity of that moment will generate more of it, and moreover that more and is also universe works.  It doubles and triples and could report the effects with every single every single time you add to that idea to that excitement as long as it still has a vibrational relevance for you and you feel the emotional or the state of being nature of the thought that you're having the first time.  It just puts it randomly out there is just like voters.  Another option the second time you think it it makes a specific and it makes it yours.  The third time you think it it doubles the powerful effect of the second time the first time you think it doubles the previous third thought, etc. so initially just throwing it out there is a random thought.  It doesn't do anything the second time you think it starts to become specific, it starts to create a lot of traction sort of effect towards you.  The third time you think of you double the effects of the second letter so but this should not become a cookie when we think think think think again was most important is that you feel good right so at some point it feels like still think something else always plant new seeds some point a particular seat, a particular imagination is done, it doesn't feel like okay now is just as uptight salmon at some point, it becomes physical on the giveaway here and sit and be in a waiting vibration, which feels really bad actually for what happens know what's the other most exciting thing I can think of can be completely unrelated.  Don't limit yourself to one passion go explore going spend yourself.  You have no idea who your three start really tapping into your imagination before you know it you're in the interests of all these kinds of things, both physical and nonphysical in his lovely is likely to be interested in physical things again, and in nonphysical things is likely to be interested is lovely to be excited because you know it's all a game because you know consciousness can die because you know it doesn't matter so why not play in accordance with your alignment.  When I generate visions that bring you so much bliss in so much joy in such a powerful example for other people to measure vibration in themselves and then one actually and of being in heaven on earth.  When a fun birthday.  What I want for my birthday.  I guess thank you or something musical in your questions over real time you describe the situation asked for.  There's a way I can just feel more power using good in the situation where a woman (or as well now dating and very intimate.  We this dynamic where I were fuses.  I was sure my love.  She has a way of just getting overstimulated and being too much in the very fact that I desire loving her could actually be too much to handle.  And she needs space and this can be a full-time Shakespearean tragedy.  Other times, only think you should and was the problem of getting good weather what you believe about it that makes it painful is inherently is for you.  Thank you.  Love you as much as you can and are going like all of me going in the room is inherently free from pain like on a molecular level there's no pain.  Physically there is no pain transmitted so it hurts you because I believe that as far out of alignment with your true self perspective of the scenario.  That's what you feel is the pain is the distance between your true vibration and where you place your vibration their perspective.  In other words, so what perspective do you have of her not being able to handle your love and how does that seem like it implies lack to you.  Lack of something like a love letter appreciation like a worthiness like capacity like skillfulness like of reciprocation of love of your cell being love labs in what way do you perceive a lack of something important to you that your higher self is telling you are there is no lack your perspective is simply out of alignment.  That's why you're hurting Mitchell to let go of think in the moment of the understand the idea that hurt comes from you suggesting something is true in life.  That's not true that the source the only source of pain is to have a perspective rooted in lack is the only thing that cannot be good.  That is a given that fact, what would you say comes up for you as a perspective that hurts when she is not able to handle what you want to give what is lacking in your mind's eye that I can ultimately have what I want perfect, which is how would you describe that in terms of equality of conscience.  What is it that you seek from your experience with her two different questions and okay you answer which everyone stood up for you them if what would you would eat what is it that you want out of that relationship bliss union often do you perceive there to be a lack of accessibility to bliss and union when she's rejecting your mama love you seems that way the stuff you know was that me is not true.  They believe that etc. if you don't believe is not true.  You continue to hurt if you take the signal.  The bad feeling is coming from the higher selves most with them letting you know without a shadow of a doubt somehow my friend, my dear Loiselle friend.  It is not whatever you're perceiving, it's not true.  There is a way for you to access bliss and union.  It's not in the thing that you think it's in it's not contained it's not leaving you.  There's no lack of it.  Somehow the bad feeling transmits to you the comforting notion if you interpreted that way that is not true that your liking.  He thinks know when that that feeling comes through and you'd recognize it as a notion from your higher self letting you know what is true.  Do you take that you believe that are you convinced enough of the truth and the wisdom the clarity of your higher self and that it's transmitted and feeling for or do you believe in your own perspective.  So if you is clearly aware if the heavy awareness of: feeling shady this post not be true.  Yes, somehow unwinds itself just say usually does the mighty little bit of practice without meaning sit a little bit with the awareness of only one second I feel bad so the perspective I had was something is lacking something fundamentally desired is lacking feels that feeling bad selling me knows not true at some point that itself becomes enough of a permission slip to go all I leave and you don't even have to see anymore how is not true but very fact that you feel bad.  You know, because you've built such a positive mutual two way relationship with yourself, you know that is not true.  You don't even have to be proven wrong anymore.  You become so not insistent upon your perspectives feeling good is enough of a signal for your Lego your insistence only doesn't do good well somehow I must of been fully myself.  All right, I'll give it up somehow there is love and light, and even have to see how somehow I know that there is love and union and suddenly your experiences immediately because you shifted to knowing that it is here and then it shows you that this year we need to prove but I have the proof instantly because you simply trusted your higher self signal them.  It just thinking off the help your scenario to again to you.  You'll be able to from that space love so freely in a way non-directionally that the directional nature of it is what overwhelms are not the love is not the amount of love is the insistence or the neediness that comes behind it from the human nature.  When you use the signal as a way to actually feel it as a radio instead of directional.  She won't be overwhelmed because you're not frying your system with a lot of other stuff as well.  Actually being a free radiator and that's magnetizing to any woman or any man, any human being or any being any creature really just a radiate love is magnetizing meaning that it will it will show itself.  Whether or not that is an actual liberation all the compatible relationship or not, but you can really know that if it's too directional, because then yes, you could be fire system or that's what experiences been the crazy roller coaster ride when I am more real.  Yet while was through the roof and that's what has me want that even becomes directional It is like a flower is put in your hand and he can either crush and on it or you can blow away and distress.  So come back right in your hand this being that openhanded state all the time seeking yourself know that you have the ability to powerfully love and that there is no greater pleasure than to love another being from such a free space of not needing them to reciprocate anything at all.  And when you do that and when you find bliss in the file state when you prioritize feeling good over the way it manifests when you really gain a maturity when you really bump your head into the wall of being attached to experiences more than enough you'll learn that what is true.  Bliss is the vibrational state itself, not the ways in which a representative but the state itself is what you're after, then a because of a director immediate and you simply start pressing a button if you want to change your feelings 00 and if you this a nice smell and feel this way knowing greatness for me so it is very self-centered in that sense, but a very beautiful way he become a master of your state of being, and of your reality which you already are your regain it consciously, intentionally, and you clarify your relations and then everyone will love you and you have more than enough to choose from and if that's an actual relational match.  It will show itself, and if it's not, it will show itself, but then at least you have found that what you're truly looking for is your own ability to activate, listen union and unconditional love and you will start to get this very subtle distinctive sense that unconditional love feels amazing unconditional love even slightly so feels terrible right now conditional love me still carry with it to hold the promise of a better future you'll start to know through the maturity through the wisdom through bumping your toe into rocks of your experience of your attachment, you will start to take a step back and know as soon you said to sense as soon as the love becomes conditional.  You know from past experiences.  Kelly deduces he only this is the only did this has got take me two weeks of listening to mention your videos to get me back to the state of being, and at some point is just no longer worth it.  No matter how pretty she is numb at her cup size number how much love you guys share with each other.  It just doesn't matter if it's not relevant if it's not true.  If it's not free.  It is not a radio and naturally reciprocated through the radial nature of love, then is no need to go down that you don't want to sacrifice the feeling good and doing good and accelerating.  You don't want to ask to sacrifice the super accelerated way of living for any duty or any check or any relationship or any promise of a better future.  As you know as soon as you believe in the probable future you're actually lowering your frequency now which will generate a worse feature it.  We want a better future.  We do feel good now and not feel good about the future of the future, but it makes you feel good now but as soon as it becomes conditional on that particular image done what were doing literally is okay to assist the planet.  This new imagination is new frequency.  It excites us instantaneously what we do because we've become sort of blame and lacking the creativity to know that we have so many passions we don't even know about because were not open to them were not looking for them so immediately after planning and receipt.  We stay with that one CME monitor how his growing area area you and Don is not growing, so we won't always be keep planting new seeds.  So yes, be in the future, but if you choose to be in the future and be always in the future and never in the present.  The euro is in the love that is the presence itself, but you always you always creating the future you never stuck on focusing on the now you never waiting for the seat that you've blended previously to Germany you moving onto the next thing is awesome conversation over the phone with this woman and is for a promising and you spoke about Lake completely fully love each other and like entering some kind of Tantric sex discourse together or whatever and like just so much hope for pleasure and love and reciprocation than any of the phone and then instead of going like I can wish that only I can with which like over the course of an hour, it can still feel good, but after two hours of service.  If you really bad.  Oh wait, has been to our specific two days.  This acceleration is happening plaintively two hours feel like today's women talk to today's obit was just two hours ago showed cardinal level of medial and many low-tech flows off and I'm not really just a God know what you do instead is you hang up the phone and you go online and if you don't climbing used in visualizing this amazing car you've been excited about and Anna Clark call comes up that somehow attract that to you or you start realizing whatever it is reset, imagining whatever else it is or you start expanding horizons so much.  You gain perspective on who you are and then at some point you never run out of things to be excited about anymore, so that you never have to wait for the past seats you're so excited about the future presence that you never actually checking how your past planets.  These are doing you plenty see then you go plant seeds.  That's what you do an annual plant seeds and then suddenly there's a flower Nicole coming in any other plan to see that you plan just shows up myself is showing you exactly how and when it will manifest you have to do that.  All you need to do is additionally keeps planning seats.  We need to do and then reap the benefits but that will come your way.  As soon as you start to wait for reaping the benefits you put depriving yourself more flowers in the future.  So just know that the best way to secure your future is the plan as many seats as you can at any given moment, and at some point there's not a 15 minute stretch where your board.  There is not a minute stretch.  We can be bored.  There's always something going on.  This is what requires all in super accelerated living is not a joke.  It's not for the faint of heart.  It's constant and constant address.  You insane.  If you not ready for it.  But you only gain as much of this as you are ready for you become completely different from what you used to be you becoming a centering on human accelerated as humans are supposed to be.  But in comparison to what we define humanity to be.  He become completely different, so be prepared and start where you're at.  That exploring start expressing stud living in accelerated life until it becomes a super color and always know that you contain all the love you need my friend, you contain all the work.
