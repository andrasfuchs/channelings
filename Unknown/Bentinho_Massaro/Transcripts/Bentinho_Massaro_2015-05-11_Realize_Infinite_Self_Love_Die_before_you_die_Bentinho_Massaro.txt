Can you hear me okay like this.  This testing is not very loud.  Are you sure are you sure not sure so everyone to get a breath, relax, take another deep breath and relax one more deep breath, or as many should like know before I go on to talk about the topic that is today's topic which is total surrender die before you die, I want to make something else clear which is maybe more important, I talked to many people of his about this kind of stuff, both in personal circles as well as in public teaching settings and what makes the difference between someone who shall I say gets what I say or gets more weight or more life by what I say right off the bat was the difference between someone that immediately feels what I'm saying and is able to let that uplift and someone who.  It just doesn't quite hit home for don't quite feel what I'm saying so the original thing all these practices emphasize what works for you if you really amazing as much as you can feel really good.  Surely expanded ever really aligned viewpoint on life.  See the way your higher self sees life.  Those types of statements for some people only aggravates their lack of that type of alignment so they might feel even more frustrated for little bit.  Or they might feel even more deprived of connection when they hear these types of words.  These types of promising qualities of consciousness.  So is the difference between someone echoes you have field and someone ago you will try okay I'm amazing.  Everything is working out for me, but I don't quite believe it.  One of the most important differences is that you have to have one of those core point of view that you need to get straightened out first which is along the lines of life is on my side.  The universe wants for me what I want for myself.  I'm worthy and capable of the things that I desire of the states that I desire the qualities that I desire of the type of self-expression and of the freedom that I desire of the love that I desire of the relationship that I desire of the manifestation capacity that I desire of the abundance that I desire of the free-flowing life that I desire even here on these beautiful words but they only a page or lack there of, or seeming lack thereof.  Vendors of core misperception at the root of your experience, which is along the lines of the universe is a fraud.  It's not working out for me.  I feel betrayed.  I feel unloved I feel unworthy's is very important that you understand that the universe is on your side.  That has to be very intimate feeling the universe is on my side and with the universe.  What comes with that is infinite possibilities.  His infinite capacity capabilities and infinite I can.  There is no place in the universe, for I cannot it does not exist what you can do.  We should can create the illusion of I cannot but it is still and I can you can create the illusion of lack of worthiness, but it is still durability and worthiness to manifest reality in which it seems that you're not there is not mentally speaking, mechanically speaking the mechanics of the universe are such that you cannot cannot you cannot cannot you can cannot but you cannot, cannot you can't can't cannot cannot cannot you follow so you're always doing something you're always creating some type of an abundance for yourself some type of a manifestation some type of experiential reality for yourself you're doing this all the time you're doing this right now and it's seamless you are seamlessly seamlessly abundant in whatever you manifest right in front of your eyes right here right now you're very seamlessly abundant in whatever you generate is a feeling state for yourself right now you're seamlessly abundant in whatever type of realization you're in as we speak what state of mind.  You are in what you are attracting to your cell as we speak.  Because every point on the line of your timeline works as a magnet.  So all the time you are attracting or generating or are on your way ever talk about a linear reality, you're on your way you're well on your way.  You're always well on your way to generating some type of experience or reality that is going to look slightly or drastically different from what you know now you're always doing this you cannot stop attracting an experiential reality and experiential timeline, a progression of some kind to yourself.  There's some kind of a momentum going on within the magnetism that is your point of I am your center of I in them except you already know actively sending out and attracting to yourself particular types of realities configurations of this universe that suit or belong to the vibrational output of your attitude of your understanding of life thinks is most important understand when it comes to attracting the life of who you are is that the Corbett you need to know that life is on your side if you don't then no matter what I say no matter what you affirm no matter what you emphasized the matter what vibrational game you play underneath that you believe that this universe just doesn't quite work in that way or it's not meant for you or your somehow separate from this life, we are isolated or you're lacking you not worthy, then it doesn't really matter when that context.  What vibrational games you play it.  Do end up feeling more like a struggle like a success story or like something that you enjoy the long run.  You might enjoy it for a day or two, or for the initial 24 hours after my meeting because your.but after that being hyped up disappears.  If your context of life is not on my side.  I'm not worthy.  I'm not capable.  I cannot.  I am limited circumstances are real.  If those type of core contextual beliefs that generate the context of your inner experience in your arteries.  If these remain in tact and untouched, then the baseline of your life will remain untouched as well.  And then what happens is that you become even more betrayed feel even more betrayed you generate the illusion of being more betrayed you anchor in more of the conviction that life does not work in this way that life does not work on your side or 40 is very important to have a look at the core feelings as to how were the you are how capable you are how much life is on your side.  How much the universe wants for you what you want.  If you believe that we get those in alignment, then we can talk about the experience of ease and generating all that is within your field of desire of passion of inspiration of expansion very effortlessly.  One moment at a time.  One moment of time.  One moment of time.  One event, one item one person, one experience at a time, but very swiftly and eats fully.  So many people that do these original games are that sort of dabble in the practice of change or frequency or change your attitude or change a vibrational state of being.  What happens is that they don't quite hit the core of their contextual beliefs and then they get even more despondent.  They feel even more like life is not working out does require hard work like they don't quite want to be here, but those are all experiences expensive.  I don't want to be here except in rare occasions or when you're really at the end of your life's theme where it's a natural process of wariness, but other than that if you feel in any way that you don't want to be here.  You know you know in back of your mind in the back of your heart that you still have juice left in you that there are still things to explore.  Then it means you fill up some kind of a resistance to the fact that your life to the fact that life is the way to that is because the way you have made life to be the way it is because it reflects the way you see or think or expect life to be the way and this is everything to do with what you believe what you expect what you perceive what you predict, so make sure that your core concept is that the universe wants for you what you want for you and that it is always actively responding to your vibrational output and things are not seemingly coming to you effortlessly.  It means you keeping them at bay, some with the belief that out of alignment is the only way the universe can seemingly not give you what you desire is if you hold onto a belief that out of alignment with this sense of self worthiness.  The sense of infinite inseparability with all that is the sense of everything can happen.  Everything has already happened, and I can traverse this field of parallel realities effortlessly, but simply shifting my attitude my belief my expectation.  My thought so get in alignment with those principles of infinite endless possibilities and that you are an extension of infinite endless possibilities ever.  How could you not generate and attract infinite and endless possibilities.  Might as well be the type of possibilities that are in alignment with the things you are inspired by how do you do that is my like gender you are happy you are excited you look forward to things but without anxiety herein and tested you are in an intestate in anticipation of some kind.  During the vibrational anticipation of some kind of miracle.  The next most amazing adventure.  You're always looking towards the horizon, but without the traditional sense of lack here now so you know you know you're perfect as you are here and now and everything is already complete your still looking forward to the next thing to the better reality to be more crystallized, more transparent reflection of who you are, while knowing at the base of your being that life is on your side that everything already happened has happened that everything is already established that everything is already accomplished that you are already perfect as you are that nothing is personal that everything is playing that everything is reflection of your vibration thing is personal and sole reflection of vibration.  So when you start to feel good at the base of your being, then it even becomes slightly less important.  What you do so is important, but it becomes slightly less crucial what you doing to service with their reparation because underneath that there's conviction.  There's faith in the knowingness that you are one with God, with the creator that you are an extension of the creator and that you therefore have all the capacities of the creator.  Hence in there for you can never be stuck.  You can never be lacking.  You can never be limited in that life is indeed on your side because there is no one else to be on the side of because there is only one oneness all and all this talk and are universe not be on your site is not possible at all to be possible if there is fundamentally to beings Indians.  The vastness of the one but resent there's only the infinite vastness of the one expressing itself is always on its own side was a work of dispersant.  Once this but I want that as well.  You won't be tuned into the liberation where you know you are already fulfilled and somehow magically you will get exactly what you want, and assuming that they do the exact same thing they get exactly what they desire to there's an infinite abundance.  There is no lack how you can get fulfilled is not dependent upon how many objects there are in his room or on this planet because even orders only so many objects on this particular planet.  There's infinite variations of this planet, with each having a limited set of items or things or events or experiences, but you see there's infant versions of center cannot be lack of sonar that life is on your side.  No, you cannot go wrong.  You cannot know that you cannot make a mistake you only learn, you can only expend you can only notice that something is not working out for you and therefore fine-tune what it is that you do desire what it is that is in alignment with who you truly are, what it is that is in alignment with the qualities you wish to exude the vibrational attitude you wish to carry with you into every day experiences in an SUV, the chosen vibration conscious, deliberate intent in practice that you will start to see the reflections of that very effortlessly come into your life and you will start to know more and more profoundly that the universe wants for you what you want free except so sometimes people that are having a near death experience like quite a bit of a near death really don't quite experience that they are leaving their bodies for sometimes that to just people where it seems obvious that they die as many reports of those people in a way becoming numb to physical reality for a moment and experiencing type of bliss or ecstasy.  Even if physical pain is present in that death creation illusion.  In that moment.  So in other words, they become oblivious even to the physical pain and it makes room for it's like as if something takes over and makes room for ecstasy.  Why is that what happens.  The moment that you are fairly convinced you are about to die.  Can you imagine for a moment.  Just take a deep breath.  Don't be afraid of exploring death in your mind.  You want attracted and less you're ready to actually die which you are not I should be dead to take a deep breath and just explored this as a tool to expand your awareness of what is true expend the experience of ease and relief.  So what if you were to be a scenario where you were convinced and you might even visualize something as gentle as just a meditation and you just know it's your time to go doesn't have to be that you're being tortured or thrown in front of us.  It can be a very gentle death but make it decisive in a way so imagine what it would be like to simply sit on your meditation cushion and being the perfect enlightenment that you are.  You have total control over when you leave your body but in a way you don't have full control.  So what it feels like is that all my life has come to any type of scenario that feels kind to you in this particular setting.  Just imagine that for a moment.  Imagine a kind death scenario and imagine what flashes in front of your mind goes through your head.  The moment you're about to die unfinished business.  Perhaps thinks you still want to do that you didn't pay as much attention to your prioritize certain things that you didn't give as much credit or value to but now imagine that there is no way for you to do this anymore in this life and you're actually about to die.  This visualization so you're forced in a way to let go of all the things that you believe are unfinished business are imperfect moments, but also the ecstatic realization that there's nothing you have to do anymore that it is finished at all.  Unfinished business is actually already finished.  No way to get back into you are done.  Imagine does until you feel really until you feel all resistance to life.  All ideas of effort and do worship and judgment of yourself and others and how life is going for you until all that starts melting away and making room and space for the state of consciousness where you are in total nonresistance because you're not occupied with selfish, arrogant thoughts, since there is no more use for you to think that you know better than life itself.  Suddenly the effort and strife disappears and the ecstasy of spirit starts enter your being source.  Enter your body even your mind your mind's eye is cleansed and you see the perfection completion of your life as it is see how perfect you've already been to see how complete of an experience of the experiment of the play a learning experience.  This has already been in a way, be prepared be ready to say goodbye to your life goodbye to your story.  Most of all, be prepared to say goodbye to your resistance and your arrogance and to think that something is not perfect is arrogant to think that something is not yet complete, arrogant to think that there is something left for you to do is arrogant to believe you're not yet good enough if not yet achieved the sinless estate is arrogant and now all of this does not matter any longer.  Your only option at the moment of death is to continue to fight or surrender completely all arrogance that you have developed over the years all arrogance all strive let all strive disappear.  Thousands of incompleteness disappear little sense of do worship and what remains to be done disappear little to do lists disappear little problems fade into nothingness and to complete a ecstatic union with spirit seeing from the bigger picture that this was a perfect experiment and you succeeded.  If you did not succeed.  You would not yet be dying, but since you are dying feel the completeness of your story as it is already with all of his perceived imperfections with all of its perceived incompleteness.  As with all of its perceived flaws with the help from a bigger perspective perfection and completeness includes imperfections and incompleteness considers total joy and relief and love bittersweet love, which then turns into purely sweet ecstasy when you give into the bitter sweetness of seeing that you are fark up and it's totally okay.  We've all been talking up all the time and it's wholly cool.  It was part of the plan all along it was part of the calculation of this experiment, it was not unexpected that you were to make humans call mistakes to see from a bigger more inclusive picture as if you are the bigger sphere that includes all the smaller spheres and stories and appearances of life you are that infinite vast sphere of consciousness itself, which perceives the whole play of this human life with all of his flaws and fallacies and lies and little incompleteness is here and they're all over the place and seated actually from this bigger perspective that was all part of the experiment.  There was a part of the journey that little part of the unique theme of expressing your self expressing consciousness in a particular way everything incomplete about you.  The human is actually part of a bigger picture of completeness at the moment of your death.  You will see this, but you can see this now.  That's why some people are in ecstasy.  The moment they think they're actually about to die users complete surrender of all resistance and arrogance.  They let go of thinking that they have things left to do.  There's no more things you can do what will your attention turned to either panic and despair, or total pocket.  I did whatever I could and it's actually quite perfect.  It's actually quite amazing.  As this is actually quite rich with experiences, accidents, and without all of those fallacies and flaws our children experience with this life ever really been really have offered as much of a richness and completeness.  Without those incompleteness that it has now to see the perfection of your life.  See the perfection of your imperfections to the completeness of your mistakes.  They're all adding to the bigger expression of life after all.  Adding to the expansion of the universe and the unique way in the one blinks neither at the light.  The dark either at success or failure.  It embraces all as an expression of its infinite possibilities.  Notice feel this and let go of all stress and strife and Jane judgment and blame and feel total self-love for you as your higher self always already has and will because it cannot see imperfection and you cannot perceived lack its vision has become that much closer to the perfect vision of all that is so higher self, higher consciousness sees everything as abundant reflections of infinity as abundant expressions of perfection.  Everyone yourself and others in your partners and your friends, your family and everyone on this planet included is essentially perfectly playing its part, adding to a bigger sphere of wholeness that is already fundamentally complete and established yet chooses to express and explore and experience itself.  In all these infinite ways, but take a deep breath and give up your arrogance that you think you know how things should be give up the arrogance cleanse your brain clench your vision from flaw and see only perfection because there is only complete perfection that does not mean you won't learn it does not mean you don't have desires or preferences that does not mean you continue to expand upon your life and how you desire to manifest you will do so from a space of ease from spaces surrender from a space of not resisting the perfection that's already here, all inclusive of all times of all spaces of all dimensions of all creations of all desires of all items of all units of all measurements of space-time of all relationships of all humans of all experiences whatsoever.  This is all part of the bigger wholeness that is the all-inclusive perfect now already here already established, already accomplished you are already perfect your already be on time.  Your life is already free of guilt.  Absolutely worthy of whatever it is that inspires you most feel amazing about yourself by simply no longer having an arrogant stance on what should be and when it should be for yourself from the perception of time and become one with the timeless point of view, which is not so much a point of view as it is the view that includes all points of view.  It's the view itself is the consciousness itself that is the timeless.  So when you are in the state of the timeless, such as at the moment of your death.  This choice is given to you, but it is given to you every second of this life.  So now that you have a visualization of your death and imagination of what would be like if I were to die right now if this was my last two breath.  What would you do with your last two breaths which you struggle with that make sense.  Would you fight it was no other way but to surrender panic to fight and believe that you know what should be I should not diet.  I have not completed this young.  I haven't built my finances in my pension is complete, you still have to call my health insurance company stuff to take care of my kids because they can't live without me.  I still have to love my partner of the ways he or she won't know that she is worthy of life you have all these arrogant stances and feel panic and feel the stress and feel struggle or will you burn through all of that in the timeframe of two breath as you every member that there is no way out that all that remains to be done is give up give but give up everything, including cynicism, including fear, including pessimism, including lack and limitation and worry and concern give up all resistance give it all up, realize that you don't know how life should manifest you only know that you ever tried your best and that your best is perfect.  Feel the love*support for you, as in those last two breath you completely surrender your arrogance.  You completely give up the thoughts that think they know what this is all about total surrender of the ego effect the death of the assumed identity and now imagine that your dad bye-bye now that your die have a view of the universe.  Few the cosmic play of all that is all the parallel infinite dimensions and realities visualize them visualize what this cosmic experience would look like without you feel what space feels like now that your dad know there's nothing for you to do other is nothing asked or requested of you of the small you has disappeared altogether.  What does the cosmos feel like what does it look is the perfection of the play that will continue to go on forever and ever and ever in the timeless state of self-exploration feel like without your arrogance in it without your struggle and self judgment without your blame and sends it.  I'm not worthy present without it present in the absence of all of your resistance.  What this is universe feel like without thinking you know what's best for you or anyone else for the state of the world order children in Africa or do slaves or your bank statement without any arrogance whatsoever.  What this is universe feel like what does this moment this timeless moment that contains all that can be what is it look like if not perfect, if not unconditionally loved and complete as it is, even in its infant stages is universe as it continues to learn and grow and expand upon the different ways in which it experiences itself is already essentially complete and the vastness of all that it can be is already accomplished.  The one infinite creator is not concerned.  It is not worried.  It does not fret.  It does not judge it does not perceive lack sin, guilt, shame mistakes and only oversees that all of itself, and it's already accomplished status only ever expressing and exploring and growing older and building new relationships from more points of view within its infinite expression of one's but how perfect all this is without your arrogance.  No re-include your arrogance and see how perfect that is as well see how perfectly complete your arrogance as to how perfectly innocent the thought.  I really need to do this.  Otherwise, unless worthy of love is see how beautiful, how pristine a vibration we awaken clear and in alignment with unconditional love.  The father I need to get does not.  I need to apologize for this, I need to be careful not to impose upon anyone is I need to not be myself.  Otherwise other people would be insecure around me.  How perfect is that arrogance how perfect is the arrogance of thinking I'll continue to live my life in a small way, so I wont stand out and I won't risk being judged by other.  I spent other brains by other cellular life forms how perfect that arrogance is the thing that you know that what you think is actually true.  How beautiful to be so hard on yourself, how perfect, how completed is to feel so incomplete is universal expression of oneness would not be complete without your arrogance.  It would be all that it is without your arrogance.  Since it cannot be any like your arrogance is completely included in the perfect picture of creation.  It is one of the ways within which the one expresses itself self judgment.  The illusion of lack and separation not being loved being supported the universe not being on your side even though it is you always allusions added to the expansion of creation but see through the game of it.  3C through the illusion of it and see it already.  Everything is accomplished and you are in a perfect timeless state of being all the time.  This is your natural state of perfection.  This is your natural timeless state of being already forgiven for everything you've ever done or not.for everything you have yet to do or not yet to do for everything you're feeling and thinking and believing now or not thinking and feeling and believing.  Now you see every moment is a perfect addition to the perfect expression of all that is and you cannot change how perfect it is what you can do is panic in fret and think you know better or surrender your thoughts go with the flow tends to your vibration by feeling as good as you can.  By knowing that life is on your side by knowing that everything is infinite by knowing that you are worthy because there is only one then you are its desired creation.  You are is desired co-creation portion you are completely absolutely worthy of everything you desire and everything you desire is immediately activated within the field of your consciousness and it tries naturally effortlessly to attract to bring into your life all the things that you are inspired to experience the universe wants what you want for yourself because there is no difference between what the universe once and what you truly desire is the same one flow.  In fact it is the universe.  It is the greater self that makes you feel desire to begin with, and since this is not a cruel set up and since the infinite one intelligence does not perceive any value in creating portions of itself that it and feeds desires that are then does not want to come true.  It wants to express it so as efficiently as I can and sort feature desires that you are able to attract an experience but it needs to respect your free will.  If you insist that you are unworthy if you insist that this life is not complete.  If you insist that something is missing and lacking from the now you will attract more reflections that will only continue to anchor and believe that everything is missing right now that what you desire is lacking right now that working as a what you desire is lacking right now, but if you give and if you surrender your arrogance as if you already died as if you don't know who you are, what you're worthy of what you're capable of as if you have no clue as to how limited or how expensive you actually are in essence in nature in consciousness in what you are.  If you let go of those insistence is of those arrogant stances that only bring you down.  It only makes you stressed that only make you feel separate from all that you are that only incapacitate you within the illusion of expressing yourself.  If you let go that if you give in to the abundance to worthiness that is awaiting your right here right now to infinity that is surrounding you that is penetrating you that is you right here right now already in timeless complete perfection and things will effortlessly show up on your reader without any work whatsoever without any struggle whatsoever.  The is the wording is the sense of belonging itself.  The connection to who you are itself will bring these things to you.  It does not require anything on your part, other than to know your natural state of infinite were to feel that you are love to know that the universe is on your side to know that there is only one at all you desire is what all that is desires of itself because there is no other.  This is one complete unity expression.  You cannot go wrong.  You cannot make mistakes, you cannot be lacking anything.  You cannot run behind on the schedule of all that is, you cannot run ahead of yourself.  Either everything is in perfect timing.  If you trust in this and enjoy the moment in the best feeling state that you have access to every moment bumping it up, bumping it up, bumping it up training it up, bumping it up feeling better and better and better and more amazed and more humbled and more loved and more worthy and more receiving and more incident more at ease, more confident convinced cleansed more resistance free.  More forgiven if you feel all these things the none of my other original games apply to you anymore.  You will see, you will be convinced you will see his life sees.  You will act as life you will feel his life feels and you will bring it to your experience, what is already there to begin with anyway but you stop resisting.  That's all you do.  So die before you die so you can actually enjoy does life before you die and you can actually experience the fullness that you are before you your anyway.  When you die.  Glad to yourself if you want to view insist that is your free will.  It's not my responsibility by encouraging more so than that to commit suicide in the way of letting go of resistance to have the arrogance that you are die in front of your eyes and be cleansed with absolute knowingness of your worthiness because when you let go of our resistance than the thought.  I am unworthy.  I am incapable.  I am limited needs to go as well and as soon as it goes your vision is cleansed and you see as your higher self is always already seen you and you will feel is your higher self is always already felt you and you will be present to yourself as yours always always already been present to you and you will start supporting yourself effortlessly as your hard-sell has always already supported yourself because you will see from the spacious spaciousness that you are instead of the contracted contraction that you think you should be stop fighting stop struggling trying for your debt when you die you will know peace when you die you will know bliss when you die you will no joy.  There is no other way.  The only thing preventing all that you desire from entering your consciousness is the arrogant believe that you are separate that you are lacking and you are unworthy if you let go of arrogance you die to greater self that your greater self can start being present to your physical focus and you will know all that I know you will flow as I flow in your unique way.  You will bring into your life effortlessly all that you desire.  Most importantly, you will feel loved.  Most importantly, you are perfect.  Most importantly, you will know the completeness that transcends all incompleteness of are you ready to stop being arrogant.  You're ready to give in to unconditional worthiness ready to receive the blinding glare of the light that comes with infinite worth a you ready to be blind blind to this world in a week to the spirit by letting go of the arrogance you thought you had to assume yet to build up around you in order to be good enough are you willing to know that you are good enough as you are right this second.  You cannot change this timeless moment so you really leave you not worthy right now you better stop working at it.  She never will be visits the same moment thousand years from now, after all the hard work after all the redeeming qualities that you build up the timeless moment of this now will still feel like the timeless moment of this now so you are doomed to fail.  If you believe that you are unworthy of unconditional love and joy and desires being fulfilled all over the place all around you all within the all throughout to give up.  The only thing I can never die is your arrogance do anything he can never die as you believe in being disconnected, but your allusion of disconnect dives that connection can become so obvious to you that it will teach you everything you want to know died before you die total let go.  You know nothing Johnson you know nothing, but you knew do know what remains when you let go of thinking you know better than the Creator itself.  That's when you'll find love instantaneously, is when you feel your infinite were well up like a fountain, like a geyser contained by your arrogance is been waiting to burst out through your eyes through your ears to your pores has been wanting to be experienced and tasted and applied to your physical focus and a myriad of ways that inspire you is infinite worth has always wanted to be utilized by you how to utilize infinite worth by feeling out of the corner of your heart.  At the core of your being by feeling into the timeless infinite perfection that you are that you cannot improve upon, but you can expand through and with and you can be an example of when he can be a statement off to all the rest of yourself this a geyser of infinite love has been wanting to come for you have been separating yourself.  You have been attaining the impossible.  You have been maintaining the impossible, which is the belief that you are disconnected when it's so obvious from every other molecular atomic point of view of creation that you are so inseparable from all that you are the cannot possibly be lacking anything whatsoever, let alone the capacity to experience the experiences you desire to experience let it flow into your being come into your consciousness by surrendering your arrogance by surrendering mommy and daddy in the form of your own mind.  They most of all, don't know anything even less than you do, but 99% of your mind consists of daddy and mommy and friends, media and external influences that you did not come here to express that you did not come here to reflect that you did not come here to become an embodied creation of you came here to bring in something new and have only 1% recognition acknowledgment of the way things are and to bring in 99% of conscious, deliberate focus from spirit into this realm of the physical focus in order to continue to do that you need to know your infinite worth.  You need to relax.  You need to melt into worthiness.  You need to melt the barriers surrounding your infinite geyser of abundance.  You need to let that melt you need to stop fighting yourself you need to start swimming upstream need to start going with the flow and trusting that your vision is already taking care of only need to know is that you and everything you desire and everything that you truly are are already one being your already loved your already complete.  Let your arrogance disappear.  It has never served you for even a second and all the while, you thought that it's you that you knew what you were talking about that you knew how life work that you knew how you should go about things that you knew how you should feel when around other people that you knew how you should act when around other people knew how you should think in order to be loved.  All of these arrogant stances are keeping that which is natural out of your view you have created an isolated corner of arrogance that you think serves you well has never served you for even a second let go of self judgment let go of believing and feeling you're not yet enough.  If you can do just that.  You can let go of the arrogance by seeing that it has never served you and it never will.  Their first futile thing to maintain and it makes no sense whatsoever.  It's dumb.  It's just stupid.  It serves no purpose has no intelligence.  All this while you've been trying so hard to not be the stupid one did not stand out is the stupid one and all this while you've been the stupid one jokes on you stop being stupid, but trying so hard not to be be more stupid so that you're actually becoming less stupid and more intelligent little life flow through your little bit become organic become more like a plan like a tree, like a flower become more organic become more natural become more allowing become more trusting you've always been taken care of, but not by your arrogance, not by the things that you picked up along the way, not by what your parents taught you none of that has kept you save over the years are protected.  All of it has kept you stupid only stop the stupidity embrace the validity of your being is not the easiest thing you can do all you need is to be willing to be done with the stupidity has kept you small and in pain and protected but you seek to protect yourself is the pain to manage your life as the struggle to control your future prevents it from blossoming stop being stupid.  Give yourself a break.  Try it out.  If it doesn't work for you within the time span of 48 hours.  I will resign from whatever disses that under and you can be right continue to be arrogant and I will happily depart since authority died many times anyway.  It will come as no surprise challenge for me give it a try and I guarantee you that if you give it a try in a way you stop trying so hard altogether and just let it be done for you is relax, just relax is relax for 2 to 5 lifetimes and see what within 48 hours you will achieve miraculous manifestations and you will be absolutely amazed and yet at the same time not at your capacity to attract what you desire how you might ask yourself how did I do that but you won't care because that's another way to struggle.  That's another way to build up arrogance and protection and try to maintain it for your future but you see there you go again being stupid make it make your only effort to feel no effort by knowing that all effort fails you when you seem very clearly in your conscious consciousness at all.  Effort has only ever failed you not passionate, inspirational motivation, not ambition, even not dreaming, not having visions being excited and into anticipation, but all effort.  All feelings of struggle have only been used swimming upstream against your own current of abundance and freedom enjoy an infinite worth to let your only effort be at your only maintenance be cannot feel any control to completely surrender all control and at the ease of the river of your higher self show you within the time span of 48 hours confirm to you proof to you anchor into you make you convinced of the fact that is is the creator of what you want and struggle is the creator of what you do not want is the way to know yourself in ways that you want and desire to know yourself expensive ways and struggle and effort in sound judgment and blame thinking you know so well what you should be thinking, feeling, what you should've done and felt only leads to the realizations of yourself that you don't want to experience the do not serve you that contract you keep you small that keep you blind to the greater purpose that you have here simply by living moment to moment you will explore more and discover more of who it is you actually are, ironically, have to give up wanting to know what it actually is not wanting to know but trying to know.  We simply trust when you simply trust in a natural timing of ease when you trust in the power that is within the ease of being here now and maintaining only non-maintenance everything only to feel no effort striving only to experience zero strike when you let that East take over when you take over with ease ease will take over your life and the manifestations that will be brought to you within the time spent in 48 hours will blow your puny little mind that's what you want is when you blow your puny little arrogant mind you will know love you will know infinite this you will know more of who you are and will note in an instant will be simple.  It will not be a process of endless endless endless self discovering them.  I do semi-dynamite this summit out of my this summer.  Yes, that will continue to some extent because you always learn more of how you wish to manifest yourself but that's only on the relative plane.  The absolute knowingness of who you are, which is unconditional light which is infinite light which is infinite worth which is endless love which is perfect forgiveness always all the time already accomplished.  You are now perfection timeless perfection is what you are you will know that without time in that instance of total let go when you die to yourself when you die to the truth when you give up what you think you know so well which is never served you for even a second you will know who it is that you are with no time between here and there between knowing and not knowing or not knowing and knowing there will be no time he was just know you will feel through the feeling state of bliss to the feeling state of liberation three experiential original state of knowing the love light the higher densities of love-life that are in need to your spirit consciousness instantaneously.  He will be unable to go back to your previous level of stupidity and you will be less and less stupid, more and more intelligent, more vibrant, more more abundant.  More and more living in East through ease and by ease generator reality that matches the dreams that you know you came here to create and mold out of this physical clay that we call physical energy which it is not.  It is an illusion that white can change within the timeframe of 48 hours.  Give it a shot.  See what it does.  If you don't like it, let me know and I'll resign.  Other people may not like you for that's okay before you make me resign.  Make sure that you do exactly as I said, because it will work.  If you do exactly as I said, if you deviate if you try to strive your way into ease to judge and blame yourself into self-love, then you will probably not see the results that I am talking about.  But if you know that if you let your arrogance die completely and you just for 48 hours.  Give life a chance to take care of your life for you what can happen in 48 hours of not managing your life, what could possibly happen that would be so irreversible that you insist upon continuing to not serve yourself every second of every day by maintaining the arrogance that thinks it keeps you say when it doesn't see what happens when you start keeping yourself safe for 48 hours you feel so safe you feel so protected.  You feel so basked in the environmental energy that is the entirety of your body, not just the physical outline of your skin, you will feel at one with the floor.  You'll feel at one with the being distant in front of you will feel at one with a partner that's abusing you you feel at one with your parents you feel one with the dead you feel at one with all that is if you feel safe because you know this is your playground and all of it is your body and of all of it is your body done.  Not a single part of your body can harm another part of your body, your body's indestructible of all it is is your body if you assume that the body is what you carry with you right here right now.  Within this physical skin, then yes, that can be harmed by all the portions of your body but you see, even when you're killed by another portion of your body, your body survives your body into as well as your body, the party that you are is nothing but the expression of incident indescribable nonphysical consciousness and in physical reality that looks like your physical environment.  It looks like the world.  It looks like the universe.  It looks like your personal life.  It looks like every experience you've ever had.  That is your body.  You are not separate from the rest of your body.  This is all inside of your sphere.  This is all dreamed up by you inside of the sphere of your IM higher self-consciousness and is generated only out of your higher self.  I am consciousness energy is no way around the fact that you're perfectly safe because everything that could ever potentially harm you, simply more of yourself.  So when you give up protecting yourself information to you give love is E is love, confidence, conviction, faith, trust in life.  Your body can only respond to that, your environment, your circumstances, which is you, which is your energy can only response to the information with the reflection of these love, joy, safety, and a sense of union with it.  I will feel as if you are thing on your back in his oasis.  The 60 x 60' oasis surrounded by palm trees and send there's no one around and no critters and original dangerous snakes and water is nothing but crystal clear water and you can see through all of it and there's nothing hiding underneath this potentially unsafe.  There's no humans for miles and miles and miles around and you take a 15 minute break to lay in a pond in total confidence knowing that there's nothing that can never hurt you in those 15 minutes and you feel that safe in every single experience of your physical life in the busy streets of New York or Boulder or nature when facing a better or when facing bankruptcy or any other type of circumstantial disaster.  Life is so but has been sold, but continues to be so bad I'm so stuck creatures of been stuck because of the circumstances public life is the most terrible I've suffered the most of all human beings must be up there with the 1% of people that suffer the most time so worthy of knowing what I'm talking about my arrogance has been validated over the years Solis continue to protect myself from what never ever happened to begin, and can never happen because you are safe because all that you experience is yourself.  See no more point in maintaining your struggle, your armor, your arrogance, your lack believes it will disappear and you shall know unconditional love for yourself inclusive of all other beings you will know the ultimate safety that can never be taken away.  You will note a ground of being within which you will find infinite refuge from the seeming illusory dangers of physical reality.  He will feel fine safe underneath always.  He will feel perfect yet ready for more excited for more of the six duration of consciousness within time and space, but you will know underneath that you are the sphere.  The timeless space the sphere that surrounds the illusion of space-time exploration.  So while you are anticipating and being excited for more of yourself to be made manifest in your consciousness.  You know, ultimately, you are the timeless consciousness that does not change the does not move that's always say that is unconditional love.  This unconditionally bright light, renaming, and has already forgiven every single thought.  Either everything single thing you've ever done desire you've ever had your already redeemed you are already liberated you already forgiven you are already low and love that you are already kept safe higher self does not need you to keep you say it's not out to punish you.  It is not out to pinch you all the time you are pinching yourself all the stuff pinching yourself and see what can happen in the next 48 hours and report if you want on this little puny thing called Facebook.  I have either group.  There you can request to join if you aren't a part of it already scope into your Messrs. teaching and community people share testimonies, ask questions and support each other or go to infinity Academy.com sign up there and go to the chart below each other know how ease is the creator of what you want struggle is the creator of what you don't want to prioritize the vibrational feeling that you have in this moment because it will determine the next few hours of your physical experience.  That's how important this vibrational experience of this moment is you are constantly creating your future.  You cannot secure your future control, but you can create your future and attract the future you desire to ease the door to trust through faith through openness through expansion through love through passion, conviction, and the safety of your being your infinitely credo.  He never left the will of consciousness.  He never left the will of your higher self.  You never left your mother never left his infinite beacon of support that surrounds you penetrate you give you life and animates you to begin with that which enables you to complain and fear and protect and be arrogant is the same energy that has kept you safe forever and ever and ever and ever and's are is no other.  How can he not be safe if all the races more of you more of your higher self loving you die before you do you can start to live before you die a deep breath and love yourself did to get another deep breath love yourself to death little resistance melt away little sense of unworthiness, slide off of you take a deep breath and love yourself to annihilation.  So what remains is the truth of your spirit.  The obviousness of your infinite were more deep breath, or as many as you like and love yourself to ease that disease struggle is death.  Don't do anything that does not feel good don't believe in anything that does not feel good don't think a single thought.  The does not feel good don't entertain a single belief that does not feel good.  All that is arrogance anything that does not feel good is arrogant and only arises so that you can let go of it not so that you can perpetuate when something arises that does not feel good embrace it by feeling good about not feeling good is a signal that you are allowed.  You are given full permission from the highest authority in the universe to let go of it safely.  If something feels bad is higher self letting you know it's safe to let go of this thought it safe to let go of this belief is safe to not do this right now.  You create abundance by following the stream of ease.  That's why feels useful since abundant and letting go of the stream of effort which is not really strain is holding on to the Boulder industry thinking that is keeping you safe from the water all the time your already wet anyway so might as well go with the ride go with the flow trust in the ease that is the vibration of now, anything that does not feel good is giving you full permission to let go of liver thought believe were action that generated the not feeling good.  This way you cleanse your misperception into alignment with your higher self and you become more enlightened total you become more awake.  Do you feel more empowered to you feel more inseparable from all that is to use humor timeless and eternal to all the things you desire are effortless and can be achieved completely and fully to the fullest is relevant for you to experience right now with the next 48 hours.  The degree to which you are ready to trust is the degree to which shall accelerate how deeply, how intimately you'll know your indestructible connection to your true self.  How deeply do you dare to trusts over the course of the next 48 hours how bored to death.  Are you with arrogance thinking you know better than this infinite mystery that is all that there is are you keeping your molecules together spinning on this earth is going 1600 km an hour, let alone the spinning motion of the galaxy and relationship to the central son of our galaxy and all that.  If so, go ahead and continue to be arrogant because then you're right.  If you do not keep your molecules together everything going on the second and every single billionth of a parallel reality that you move your consciousness into if you are not the one actively consciously managing your breath, your heart beat your molecules.  Some hosting into place your atoms moving in such a way that you can call it movement.  If you are not doing that.  If you are not managing the rotation of his Milky Way galaxy right now and all other infant galaxies within the vastness of infant exploration of the one if you're not consciously maintaining that then you are consciously maintaining anything but the way that you feel and interpret all that has been created by your higher consciousness so that your higher consciousness take care of you as well, as it takes care of the spinning of the galaxy takes care of the spin of the galaxy and all the trillions of stars and planets in beings inside of even just as one puny little Milky Way galaxy simultaneously holding that intelligence to all other galaxies out there which are infinite in number by the way, which also arches together altogether.  One particular universe.  But there's many alternate universes infinite once in fact, if you are doing all that simultaneously in the now.  If you are consciously already.  The all at his level of consciousness.  If you are aware of all that there is and can be right here right now than me.  My guess and continue to be arrogant dish of all the rights to be and you should be sitting up here, not me since none of you are consciously managing the intelligence of all that there is why do not let that same power that manages galaxies take care of the simple thing such as what you want to do in life or how much money you want in your bank or what type of an experience you want to have with other people or what vibrational attitude you want experience or how much goodness you want to come into your life as it must be so so hard for the universe to create things through his is it so busy spinning coccyx and must not have time for me but are you upholding the structure of your atoms are you giving conscious shape to your physical body right now.  If you've achieved that level of consciousness.  If you merge to that extent with your higher consciousness.  Your higher mind than again, be my guest and be arrogant.  It will serve you, but since were not that intelligent data were on our way to becoming that intelligent to retracing our steps all the way back to the infinite want diminishing the distortion of the vibration of our personally assert itself in our crew.  So since were still on the journey that joyful exploration that spiritual path fuel.  Let us be humble and let in the goodness that we are let infinite intelligence is what we want because it were worthy of it.  And we desire it because it desires it for itself through all portions of his self.  That's how it attracts what remember infinite worth is logical.  You're not keeping your body together right now you're not spinning out of control your trillions of cells are not flying off into space you not managing gravity managing the beating of your heart.  You can but you're not which means you're not that intelligent and vast, yet in your conscious consciousness, which means that the relevant for you to explore this level of consciousness.  In addition to the universe to the relevant for you to be where you're at, but then led to the higher consciousness take care all that you are and all that you want and you cannot do that if you really believe that you have to take care of yourself through carefulness through making concessions to signing contracts and agreements something a little bit for someone here so that they will do something a little bit for you here.  What a puny way to live puny God.  Don't be a puny God be trusting God you are God but you create, including creating a tiny little contract to live in and you wonder why why you don't want to be here anymore.  One question for all wires and life on my side because you're not a nurse.  I think you get in your site because you see your soul unconditionally loved her so loved without conditions.  You're so supported without conditions.  They are absolutely supported in all that you believe so you believe your separate and unworthy than all that it can give to you with reflections that reflect that.  That is how unconditionally supported you're in what you believe so you have to get on your site your free will is paramount to the creative process how it created created you in the image of free will.  You are the free agent, so it is your responsibility to start taking care of yourself by no longer believing that you have to take care of yours but trust instead of faith instead feel expended instead of conviction in the goodness of all that there is this flowing into your being.  Right now that's keeping yourself together as we speak.  Did you don't have to manage her so much else.  In fact, there's everything else that you don't have to manage all you have to manages feeling good.  The only task you've been given that make sense as a human being's to feel as receptive as receiving of infinite abundance is allowing as you can be as trusting as you can be that is your only job as a human being that make sense for you to should be in everyone's job description is the only thing sensible feel-good.  It gets the job done.  Feeling good gets the job done.  I don't know how but I do know why because this is a singularity.  This is one being and if there's one being the trees infinite points of view of itself.  It is not out to hurt the city portions of itself.  Who here enjoys grabbing a hammer and smashing your toes every day dated dated even with your little toe to the smallest of the do you do with the smallest of these smash it they give you joy will make you think that the one being the private joy gets joy extracts joy from punishing itself.  What infinite intelligence do that but even conjure up the idea of unworthiness.  It hurt itself.  Use of separate and contracted then give itself everything he does not want.  It is one being to give that itself was a well I want this but what you really want us to not give that to myself using this one so say to relax.  This was a safe to let down your armor and be completely exposed so that you could noted vulnerability is a myth on SP1 or Bob know you can't.  You can expose yourself to all of yourself but vulnerability has never existed, it would imply that you can encounter something is not yourself in a singularity.  There is no room for self-hatred is no room for separation in the singularity as vast as the one is.  It lacks room for separation is just not enough room in infinity to include separation as it would need another room.  Is only one room, so that's impossible separation means there's two rooms the one infinite vastness is too infinite, too big to generate two rooms can do it if you mean that there infinite one is not infinite.  Only then can you make room for another room but since infinite is all inclusive.  You cannot have another infinity.  By definition, the infinite one is infinity.  You cannot have room for another infinity because that would mean that the first infinity was not infinite since the first infinite is truly infinite beyond our ability to comprehend or even imagine.  Carries no room for another is no room for another in the infinite one that is all that it is there is no room for another infinity.  Infinity has no room for anything but itself that's what is right at some logical to be enlightened.  It's fun when the brain suddenly starts making sense like okay this actually quite logical what's called enlightenment teacher guru my God, what have you realized that I cannot realize logic clearheaded observing a new listening, observing and noticing until you come to your senses until you align what you think you see with how things actually work when you empty out your arrogance so that infinite abundance and clarity of vision and accuracy of perception can fill in the blanks.  You just need to be blank by blank.  I mean, for a spacious ease not worry about the way things work just be in the joy that you want to be in being the easy want to be in gets the job done.  He gets all chop to change your job description to justice show it to your employer.  I change my job description anything just to be a list of 25 things, but now it says feeling good :-) I think you'll get more should not and if he or she does not agree with them far you said this is all I want to do from now on.  Do you agree we pay for this.  In fact I think I have so much more done.  I kind and demand double the salary you've been giving you think of a good plan of.  It is a great let them far you and bring it every other interview of any job that inspires here.  This is what I wanted to for feeling good.  Someone hires you when you see that you know you find the right employment and otherwise start something for yourself.  Quit your job gets the job done, but we don't trust that anymore, but if you get yourself 48 hours let go all tension to disown all thoughts that make you feel bad to let go all struggling ideas just insist upon on insistence be convinced that everything is created for you and you can simply let go a little tension with note I'm going to spend 48 hours and absolutely clean state where I don't believe in anything, especially nothing that feels bad if it feels amazing and is not even so much of believe it simply an aligning perceptions insured forms its own belief system because it that's foot structures reality but really at the core of it you're not on the delusion of believing in something.  It's just a way of seeing life is a very organic flowing state of being where your point of view is very malleable and it's in alignment with some of the principal vibrational truth of existence.  You want to be in that state and the only we can be effortlessly, naturally, convinced in that state is if you let go of anything that pops up just don't even go into it for the next 48 hours.  Don't even apply anything that I told you before, unless she feels really really relevant for something comes up for you, but as a general rule for the next 48 hours and you can extend that to next Monday if you want to went soon as a thought comes up that she is bad.  It feels like a struggle that feels like it comes from you thinking you know what's going to happen and what you need to do in order for it to happen smoothly and interviewed yourself safe because your managerial molecule so you should also measure the just instantaneously remember that has never served you.  It is rooted in stupidity, not intelligence contraction not infinite abundance of all they desire and then choose the opposite and by simply already deciding to let go of it of the first moment you notice it that already put you in a state of abundant joy, just that you don't even have to remember the way the universe actually works unless you go down the rabbit hole too much of the negative thought and you need to sorta retrace your steps by acknowledging everything that goes well what you truly are, what you know that is true but the universe that you are supported look to the obviousness of how this is already created for you.  Notice the obviousness of how things pop up when you align yourself with your true vision and you have to like retrace those types of acknowledgment, but if you can catch it in the early stages of spinning out of control into the negative of arrogance of thinking you know better than the flow of these if you catch yourself right there, you're instantly still in the space in the responsive trampoline mode where you can bounce back up into line into ease.  Oh yeah I remember I almost went down the rabbit hole, but it's so joyful to see that I didn't.  And if I did.  It is also joyful to see that I did also be arrogant to say that it was bad of you to go down to negative spiral.  So if you got lost for a couple hours and you like chat I'm depressed again.  What did I do what I do wrong, that's another thought that is negative in nature that arrogant in nature.  So let that one go and remember that is amazing that you went down into the spiral depression for two hours without noticing that it's such an abundant experience of perfection that are already perfect and then you can still use the trampoline to bounce back up and alignment always feel good whenever you can't catch yourself in a conscious moment.  Let your response to what you have caught the fish that you've caught let your response be joy, confidence, gratefulness, thankfulness happiness that you have seen this humility that you can now choose your way.  Once again, always be grateful for the fact that you're having a moment of consciousness, even if trigger the moment of consciousness was a negative feeling.  Are you happy that your conscious again.  That is due to the negative feeling.  Don't be area and by judging it.  Be grateful.  It showed you to be conscious once again.  What more do you want make sense so constantly jumped back up into infinite worth infinite love for yourself infinity easing remembering that he's curious what you want somehow magically just let it do its job.  Being in knees will track everything you need to get done and do and have created for you so you can just follow Mary's viewer feels useful.  Think what is useful and even extended to doing what feels blissful thinking what feels blissful believing what feels blissful seeing in ways that feel joyful and this one ecstatic euphoric and then somehow magically without your arrogance include, without you having protected yourself for it at times been a 48 hours without having thought you knew better than the mechanics to keep every spiraling galaxy of billions of stars and beings together you not questioning authority simply trusting that the weight communicates to you what is the most efficient way to go about things is what feels the easiest, the most joyful, the most pleasurable.  The most exciting and as you follow the joy he follow the bliss of course with honoring your integrity truly falling your true joy will never dishonor someone else will never deprive someone else of what they want and desire.  So, following your true joy will always naturally organically maintain integrity and balance to have to worry too much about that for a more about funny on what truly gives you join this moment what is truly in alignment with who I am what feels completely expensive and holistically integral to who I am is a being what do I really want to do what's really valuable and beautiful to me right now what do I really want to think it brings me joy.  Does this spot bring me greater joy towards the spot bring me greater joy.  I choose the thought of receiving the greatest join and suddenly I noticed I want to go for walks and I go for walk and enemy.  This person wants to do everything for my business that I can do myself but if I were stay home thinking of my job description consists of those 25 things I would never have met this person I would still be miserable and I would still be creating more work for myself out of working out of working out of working hopefully to get to the end of work being in a state of work or effort attracts more itself.  Everything you do and think and believe and feel attracts more of his own nature likes to like so having chosen the most blissful joyful thought and then having been inspired to go for walk you suddenly very effortlessly.  You didn't do shift no effort and fall.  No hard-working fault.  No struggle, no.  So judgment no pain no gain ideas just a lot cartridges you enjoy being with believes that the wind so magically us to do so, you enjoyed this one in nature and you this person somehow going to have a dog as well.  She started chatting all kind of dog is that the mix is would you do with my business card.  Awesome, but I would really love to do this and somehow magically Utrecht everything into your life that needs to get done missing you will never ever put your hand on a pen and write something yourself missing you won't be doing anything but it will be out of flow.  It will be out of joy.  He will be out of inspired, effortless, spontaneous, obvious action.  Yes, of course, let me do this rant.  Let me write this email to the data entry.  What is the best thinking was the best feeling thought Alex is throwing up Craig okay what is inspiring me to take action on no nothing.  It just wants me to sit here for a moment and have another wonderful thought.  Oh great.  This unit is really is amazing.  While it really allows everything to spend in orchestration and perfect completeness should before you know it you're in a spontaneous half an hour of meditation without having watched the clock and we can often do your meditation every day you just spontaneously into a meditative state and your group rules of you and you had.  He stays around realization without even trying to attain it without even studying the oldest address for the issues naturally happen because you are in such a state of joyful absorption attitude care of everything because you were not being arrogant.  And when you're not being arrogant.  The geyser of true wisdom and true joy in true love and true buns and everything you can ever possibly desire and so much more and you're not aware, because Americans will flow through you effortlessly with's with joy and fulfill you will be perfect.  Complete reality, not anything left out mistaken anything to regret or be guilty about it will be obvious because it is so obvious to the creator.  If you line yourself, align yourself with the way the creature sees life which is ease and joy in self-love and everything you desire is its own desire so on are what you desire a letter not honoring the union address.  Although there is so on.  What if you honor what you want on what feels amazing and bump it up and bump it up and bump it up and bump it up house.  Her effortlessness rejoiced through.  Trust me greater conviction greater conviction that life is on your side greater conviction.  Everything is already in your field already accomplished.  You don't need to do anything but feel good be receptive allow expansion letters for the shop for the first time ever give it a shot for the next 48 hours see what happens to it.  Cannot let it blow your puny little mind into oblivion.  That is to die to your greater self they can be reborn in the been joy, love and abundance infinite generosity infinite freedom.  Class dismissed.  I love you very much and I'm done with this meeting and so are you all so enjoy your night
