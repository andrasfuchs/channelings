1
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:46,320
Unknown: Hello, Russia, okay. Oh, I love you. We love you as well. This is my second time to be in your channeling. I was sitting in Sedona last month. All right. I'm from Hong Kong cosmetic surgeon and also do age management medicine. Yes. I'm US citizen for last 15 years I work in mainland China last two years. I work in Hong Kong. Yes. Now, everybody knows Hong Kong happening, you know, big tragedy.

2
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:58,170
How can you see things happening to in Hong Kong, from your planet? And my question is

3
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,000
who supported

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:14,820
This protesting and I cannot involve myself in your political machinations on Earth. Okay, how long it will last? The repercussions will probably last about a decade.

5
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,590
A decade. A decade is 10 years. Yes. From now. Yes.

6
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:50,040
Is going to be like a big mess. Now, last 14 years, the repercussions it will come down like ripples in a pond. Okay, you understand the idea of the splash, the initial splash will dissipate within perhaps one to two to three years at the most but the repercussions, the things that are connected to it, the things that will cause will ripple out for at least a decade.

7
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:59,970
Others will be affected in different ways by what has already happened. It will diminish over time, but the ripples

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,150
will last about 10 years. So what's the destination of the Hong Kong?

9
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:30,600
We cannot give you an absolute eventually, eventually. Okay. But again, you're talking about needing some time, probably at least two to three decades before your world experiences the idea of global peace in every single place. Because there are a lot of things that need to be worked out a lot of changes that have to happen.

10
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:59,880
is China governmental will I don't know how to how to see that we will take over or it's your be like make a peaceful? What is the future of Hong Kong? Again, you have to understand there's no such thing as an absolute future. There are many probabilities that you all haven't decided yet. So there are things you can do.

11
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:59,910
To make one particular kind of future more probable, and that is the sharing of information about the idea of being yourself being your true following your passion in the way that we have described, and everything, eventually, the more people that do that it will lead eventually to a very prosperous and peaceful, constructive future. But that's in your hands. It's not absolute, because not everyone will decide to do that. And they will split off into another reality, a different Hong Kong on another Earth. That won't necessarily be the same Hong Kong, you will go to remember, there are already an infinite number of Earth's that exists with very different realities on them. You are still as a group, as a people choosing which earth you will eventually wind up on and which

12
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:19,560
Hong Kong or Los Angeles or New York, you will experience so make your choices now to start navigating in the direction of the earth that you prefer to be on. Do you understand? Yeah, I understand. So that's, that's, that's what I decided from

13
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:47,520
a few months ago decided to go to all over the world to exploring to learn new technology, new things, and decided to watch War Two, I will do where I will go. So I was seen as Switzerland and Germany to study and then you may take all of that back to Hong Kong and what you have to share may make a big difference in terms of the direction and the future they experience along with you.

14
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:59,160
Everyone needs to play their part. Everyone is a seed. You water yourself, you give yourself enough light, you will grow others will begin to see you grow.

15
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,550
They will want to learn how to grow like you.

16
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:49,440
by the presence of your being. That's all you have to do to be of service and allow people to choose to change in more positive ways. Just be yourself. That's the biggest impact and biggest help you can possibly have. Just be yourself. And it will rub off on the people that needs to rub off on. But not everyone will choose to go down that path. And that's all right. Eventually, you will not experience any other path than the one you chose, along with the people that also chose a similar path. And if you're choosing a path of beauty and peace, then that's what eventually you will experience in a Hong Kong full of people who have chosen to experience that while on another Earth. People may have chosen something different and will experience something different. But it won't matter to you because you won't experience that world anymore.

17
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:59,910
That's how it works. You never change the world you're on. You shift to a different Earth based on the change you made within yourself.

18
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:05,730
That is more reflective of the vibration of that version of Earth.

19
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,480
Makes sense? Yes, it does. Alright.

20
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,120
Well, I am kind of confused. Congratulation.

21
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:39,120
That's good. Because what you're doing is unlocking from an old way of looking at it and starting to look at it a new way. And for the moment, you might be a little co fused with two different reality ideas. But eventually you will figure out which one works for you. And then you will crystallize that vision and you won't be confused anymore.

22
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:45,180
Right now you're in kind of a limbo state. Yes. Yes, son.

23
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,350
You're shifting gears. Yeah, well, when you shift gears, you have to first go through neutral.

24
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So you may not really feel like you're anchored to anything. You may be a little confused out of your element. Not sure

25
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:18,450
where you stand not sure what to do. But that's part of the process to go through that neutral state. Because you have to do that in order to unlock from one reality and lock into another, just like you have to unlock from one year and lock into another. If you just bring the gears together without the neutral state, you'll strip the gears.

26
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:40,620
See this? So it's all right, enjoy your confusing vacation from one particular reality or another. It will give you the chance to really figure out what it is you prefer to do. And as soon as you really crystallize that for yourself, you'll mess right in to the new reality. The gears will click.

27
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:59,970
Okay, yes. Okay. Another question. Since I'm doing the age management medicine, yeah, I also do the hormone treatment and lifestyle treatment. Alright, so I find out some of my clients, they have two more and that the cancer Yes. So So

28
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:42,480
I wanted to ask you, what do you think of the cancer? What's the conversation? What is? Well, first and foremost? Well, it can be many reasons and there can be positive or negative ones. But first and foremost, in general, you're talking about the idea of stress and resistance to being the true self. Because then the body is not certain who it is. And therefore it starts to become something other because the person is trying to become something they're not. Therefore the cancer reflects the idea of them being not themselves by turning into a foreign element. You understand your needs, the stress is stress, but the resistance of not being your true self.

29
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:59,910
Many people on your planet have belief systems in which they experience trying to be someone they're not. You understand. Most people on your planet are not being themselves. They're trying to be someone else. They're trying to be who other people think they should be.

30
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:40,200
You understand? And when people try to be someone else other than who they are, they're sending a message to their body, that they are not themselves. And therefore, the cells in the body become something other than themselves become foreign and attack the body. Yes, you understand what we're saying? I'm kind of not exactly understand. All right. Do you understand that you have a particular path? That's true for you? Yes. Do you understand that many people on your planet do not walk their true path? I understand. So what do you think happens when someone doesn't walk their true path? What do you think happens to them?

31
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:58,860
If they're not walking their true path? If they're on a path that's not for them? Isn't that path going to offer a lot of struggle and pain and resistance in their lives? And what does that struggle and pain and resistance turn into music cause the cancer yes

32
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:37,230
Because they're not flowing on their path. Now, again, there are exceptions. Sometimes people can create that not because they need to learn a lesson from it, but because someone else they know in dealing with them and interacting with them may need to learn a lesson from it. So you have to take it on a person by person basis as to why they may have created the cancer experience. But we're talking in general, most people that create the idea of cancer in your society is because there is resistance to the natural self and the body picks up on that and therefore turns into something else other than them.

33
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:50,700
Yes, what is the, you know, two of my clients they are having the cancer now the having the chemotherapy and the radiation therapy.

34
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:59,970
When a good friend of mine she had breast cancer two years ago, yes and after the treatment, the cancer

35
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:12,510
disappeared. But now this year, yes, two months ago, it's it's moved to the lung. The underlying reason hasn't been discovered and been dealt with.

36
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:35,220
You can use many things to make it appear to go away. But if the underlying energetic vibrational reason that it started to begin with is still there, it's obviously going to come back. So the person must deal with the belief system and the real underlying reason why that person is not being their true self.

37
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,790
Yes, you understand.

38
00:11:39,870 --> 00:12:00,000
They need to deal with it mentally, spiritually, energetically to find out what they believe to be true about themselves. Most of these ideas go all the way down to a very fundamental fear based or negative belief that is most commonly expressed as I'm not worthy. So there must be something

39
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,610
In that person that is allowing her to believe she is not worthy to be herself.

40
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:30,510
That's what has to be dealt with, as well as anything else that you might call a physical treatment. You have to deal with the source of why the body is out of alignment, which is always a belief system. It's always the energy of the belief. Yes. So the person has to deal with that as well. Otherwise, it'll just come back if they haven't dealt with it.

41
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:38,940
Is that's enough. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. I love you. I love to you as well.

42
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:59,040
David Sharpe, and to you good day. I'm so glad you're here. I appreciate you sharing the formula with us. It's Breton me many interesting things. So we thank you for being willing to apply it in your life because that's what makes the difference. We can talk all day long about all sorts of ideas and principles, but only when you apply it. Do you get the proof that it works. So thank you for applying it. Good having the information? Yes. When Willow was with us here previously, she talked about the ocean and they have a process of de salud nating ocean use for water. Yes. Is there any information you could share to help us learn how to use that technology? Well, again, it's based on resonance. So they have certain devices that contain filtration systems that each vibrate at certain frequencies. That allows the salt to go one way and the water to go another

43
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:30,300
Lot of these are tubular in nature and the outer structure would appear or the inner structure, I suppose you would call it because there is the main inner structure, but there is an outer sheath. But the main structure is tubular but has many openings. And if you would say perhaps that it looks like it's almost woven in a crosshatch pattern all the way along, and there are layers of this and each layer operates at a certain frequency that distills out the salt from the water.

44
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,940
Does that make sense to you?

45
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:59,970
Somewhat. All right. Well, obviously, this technology is something that your planet hasn't invented yet. Therefore, it may take a little bit of investigation, a little bit of understanding of the difference in frequencies between salt and water, and being able to create certain kinds of containers through which the water flows. That actually removes the salt because it is attracted to harmonic frequencies that are representative of its structure.

46
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:20,370
How do we figure out what the different frequencies by getting the different substances to resonate and measuring what those frequencies are? And then duplicating those frequencies in a device that would cause those materials to be drawn toward their harmonic frequencies and pulled out of the water.

47
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,820
That's awesome. Well, yes,

48
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:49,320
it works quite well. How do I become more aware of dreaming while I'm dreaming? I don't know if I remember well, it can work differently for many different people. You can give yourself a symbol that when you see something in the dream, it will remind you that you're actually dreaming and you can become lucid. That works for some people. But you will have to find what works for you on your own.

49
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,570
Because everyone is different.

50
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:00,000
When I'm, when I'm creating art, or sometimes when I'm dancing,

51
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:08,010
I can feel something else come through me or maybe lots of other things coming through making it One moment.

52
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,740
All right, here's a suggestion that may begin to work for you. As we pick up on your vibration.

53
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,600
Tell yourself to dream about a clock.

54
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:28,770
Follow me so far, yes. When in the dream, you see the time on the clock,

55
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,530
tell yourself to look away and then look back. In a dream, the time on the clock will never be the same.

56
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:46,710
And therefore that might remind you that you're dreaming and help you become lucid and awake in the dream.

57
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,460
Okay, all right. Yeah, definitely.

58
00:16:52,800 --> 00:17:00,000
Anything else in in times when I'm like, either making art or sometimes when I'm dancing, I think

59
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:42,840
feel, I feel like it's not me. I feel like there's something else. That's cool. It's more of you. It's more really coming through. Yes, of course, because you're also feeling all the connections you have, and identifying more strongly with those connections, which can sometimes be interpreted or translated as not being you. But nevertheless, it's just that you're experiencing more of the connections that you made to more of yourself in different places and times and forums and so on and so forth. So it's just more of you. Ultimately. That's, that's awesome. Yes, it is. Anything else? Yeah. But I've always had connections with cats. They tend to treat me like another cat. It's just my

60
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,060
is that my expectation that they do that or is it well, it's your vibration.

61
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,990
They recognize that you are giving off a familiar and similar vibration to them.

62
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,430
Is that awesome, too?

63
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:05,910
It is for sure. I believe you have a song on your planet. Everything is awesome.

64
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,300
Sounds like your theme song.

65
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,510
I think it is today. All right.

66
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:59,970
So Will that do? Um, you've said before you were expressed geometrically as opposed to mathematically can. Can you explain that a little further? Yes. Instead of using the idea of mathematical equations to express physical principles, or physics principles, we have consolidated the idea down into geometric forms. For example, you have what's kind of called an exclusion principle. You can't, shall we say, in certain circumstances, measure the speed and the position simultaneously of an object. Because once you measure its position, you have frozen the speed. If you measure the speed, you don't know where it is. You don't know what's

67
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:17,310
position. This is expressed in your physics along mathematical formulas. But from our point of view, it is perfectly expressed by the shape of a tetrahedron. You have innocence a four sided pyramid creating three

68
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:59,850
equals lateral triangles facing up and one as the base. You follow me? Yes? Well, the idea is that there are three points on the base, let's just say ABC or XYZ. And that represents the idea of, let's say, the physical position, but the fourth point is up here, not in the same plane as the other three particular notations. Therefore, it is up here and that is the component of time, momentum if you wish. So the idea is that you can have two components of space and one of time but you can't have all three components of space.

69
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:12,930
One at a time because they're not in the same plane. So that's an exclusion principle expressed by a tetrahedron rather than a mathematical formula. Does that help? That does hope. All right, well that do.

70
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:21,210
Why does it feel so important to be barefoot at times, so you can connect to the earth more directly?

71
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:28,890
Nice. Well that do. Thank you so much. Awesome. Much love.

72
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:59,610
Greetings, Bashar. Either you Good day. Just want to say thank you and Darryl, for sharing all the information you share over the years. Again, both of our passions and our pleasures, and it's very exciting to be here. First time in LA

73
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:03,660
Live event. All right. Me too.

74
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:29,160
I'm just wondering, I have a memory when I was very young around five years old. Yes. I thought I saw gray. I'm not sure that's not uncommon. usually starts that early if you're part of the hybridization agenda, and that's another question that Mr. Just answered it. Okay. And for hybrid children do I have you do have some genetic material and several hybrid children? Yes.

75
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:43,260
And also was curious, that ever die in chose to come back? Well, you sort of did. You've got very close close enough. I suppose that it counts. Okay.

76
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:58,170
And also, I'm curious, is there any information that my higher mind can share with me? About what, anything in general Well, in general, follow the formula okay.

77
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,510
You will have all your answers when you need them. Perfect.

78
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,570
Guess that's it. Thank you. Thank you.

79
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:16,950
Yes.

80
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,820
Hello Bashar One moment.

81
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:54,720
Thank you

82
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,910
Okay, so enjoy your good day.

83
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:12,300
Whoo. It's really wonderful being in your energy, honestly, and yours as well. Thank you.

84
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:21,150
Would you like to discuss? So recently a good friend of mine transitioned and how exciting for you.

85
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,960
Now you have someone on the other side

86
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:43,530
pulling strings for you definitely felt her. So I'm wondering if I shift into a parallel reality where she's still alive? What do the people in the other reality experience happens to me? Or does it just split into all the possibilities?

87
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:58,350
Everything happens at once. It depends simply on what is relevant for your focus as to what you experience of that nature. And others will create or not create the version of you that they need to say

88
00:23:59,730 --> 00:23:59,970
okay,

89
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:06,900
How do you stop that from feeling too realistic or two?

90
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,190
How do you stop? What from feeling realistic? The shift? Why would you want to stop it?

91
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,760
You are implying that there's something to be afraid of here.

92
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:36,060
I guess it feels like the people around me are singular instead of shifting constantly. Yes, I understand that's the illusion of continuity in physical reality, but it's an illusion, you're constantly shifting.

93
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:57,450
Okay? It is definitely comforting to know that but at times, it can be a lot to take in. Well, it can be a little disorienting when you're not used to it. But it's part of the evolutionary process of your growth, to understand more and more and more of what's already going on, to be able to comprehend more and more and more of the shifting you're already doing.

94
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:24,450
If more than you're shifting, you just become more aware of the shifting you're already doing. And you can use it more consciously, to your benefit by navigating through it in the way that you prefer, in the direction that you prefer, toward the reality experience that you prefer. By following the formula, that's all you have to do. You don't have to overthink this or get caught up in the minutiae of the mechanism.

95
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:58,980
Don't overthink it, don't overcomplicate it, just follow the formula. act on your passion to the best you can. No assumption no insistence on the outcome. Stay in a positive state no matter what happens so you can receive the benefit. Therefore, in that context, nothing can go wrong. Whatever happens is what needs to happen. And it won't matter what happens because it's not about what happens. It's about what you do with what happens that makes the difference in your reality experience. So why be afraid of whatever it is that might happen when you know that the only things when you're in that state that can happen are the things that serve you

96
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:08,070
Who cares? What happens, you can use everything to your advantage, because that's how powerful all of you are.

97
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:26,640
So why not follow that track and stop worrying about the things that might happen? Because the things that happen in the state you prefer are only the things that serve you. That's the definition of that state. You can't have something different in that state.

98
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:39,120
Is this making some sense? 100%? Yes. Is this helping? Yes. Thank you. All right. And my last question is, so what happens if consciousness goes through black hole?

99
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:59,460
depends on the kind of black hole, but do understand that everything is made of consciousness? I do. So you're simply saying what happens if one form of consciousness interacts with another form of consciousness that happens to express itself in this particular way? It depends upon what the interaction is about.

100
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:16,950
It can be many different things. The kind of consciousness you're talking about going through the kind of consciousness represented by a black hole can have many different effects. It could allow you to experience yourself exploding not only into but as another universe.

101
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:22,860
That's one effect that can happen suddenly are a new universe.

102
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,620
Yes, yes. Thank you very much. You are very welcome.

103
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:43,920
Hello, today. Oh, hello, nany.

104
00:27:46,380 --> 00:28:00,000
We have about 30 minutes left. So you have some questions from other. I do have a few. All right. You want me to do that first, as opposed to pulling some more names right now? Questions.

105
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,160
from others, okay, is what they're all screaming right now.

106
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,400
Okay.

107
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:18,900
First of all everybody wants to know, does the Is it a 24 hour period for the

108
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:42,720
event in Joshua Tree midnight under the hunter's moon, right so you can be there before you can be there. But they're trying to figure out if it's Saturday night because Saturday's the 12th and then the midnight and becomes the the 13th. So then you're seeing Sunday night which Yes, yes, yes, yes. Okay.

109
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:54,930
Everybody midnight of the 13th. midnight of the 13th which is a Sunday. Correct. Okay, great. Thank you for clarifying that. Yes, I'm,

110
00:28:56,010 --> 00:29:00,000
of course people in Europe really want to know if there's any place they can

111
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,200
Go in Europe,

112
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:21,060
where they are Asia or Australia or this is a particular portal with a particular purpose and a particular event right now, we will give similar ideas, similar timings and locations for other places around the globe after this one that has occurred.

113
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:22,890
Okay.

114
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,680
There were some more

115
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:34,080
questions about Atlantis? Yes. So speak up, speak up. Okay. I'm looking for them.

116
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:46,620
What represents the best of the Atlantean civilization? In other words, can we aspire? What can we aspire to in this new Atlantis

117
00:29:49,440 --> 00:30:00,000
the knowledge that was left in the chambers that exists will be the knowledge of the architecture. They've left behind the

118
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:28,320
incorporates many different kinds of cosmic and mathematical principles that will help you understand how reality works. Technological ideas that you have yet to discover will be in there. They weren't necessarily more advanced than you, but they were differently advanced than you. And so the knowledge and information that you will discover about them will give you a different way of expressing some of your technology that you may not have realized yet.

119
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:40,800
Also, ideas of more about how to propagate foodstuffs in a more natural way to feed the world.

120
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,100
Young

121
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:59,970
regarding Atlantis and the cycle that's ending and the new Atlantis cycle that's beginning Yes. Does this correlate to approximately the

122
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,160
26,000 year precession of the equinoxes No.

123
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:06,690
Okay.

124
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:37,560
Okay, this is a question that's different. There is controversy over the Joker film, as some believe it will inspire lonely males to violence against an unfair economic system in the West. Is this male centered nihilism related to Atlantis?

125
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,440
You're joking, right?

126
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:58,590
In general, yes, it is the imbalance of the male and female energy that was expressed through many of the males that allow there to be the vibration that brought about the destruction.

127
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:09,210
Could a human being naturally breed with an Orion? Did this actually occur in Atlantis? No.

128
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:17,790
You must understand that the ancient Orion systems that we're talking about,

129
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:28,110
we're talking about something that is millions of years ago in your calendar, not thousands of years, millions of years ago.

130
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:46,170
At the end, did the Atlantean civilization rely too much on technology and lose their balance with nature? Many of them did. Yes. Is that why you're always telling us to get out in nature more? It's one of the reasons that balance is crucial.

131
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:54,150
You remain grounded, so you can reach for the stars in a balanced way.

132
00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:00,000
So this is from the same person that asked

133
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,250
The Joker question yeah.

134
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,030
And I'm not joking.

135
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:16,710
Speaking of Halloween, do SSID have any cultural horror stories that they would like tell tall tales of earth to frighten are

136
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,070
just joking.

137
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,580
No, of course not.

138
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,270
Behave or all send you to Earth.

139
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,950
No papa.

140
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,090
No mom.

141
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:57,330
Do you share any stories that have things like werewolves and vampires, Freddy Krueger

142
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,830
As I said earlier,

143
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:32,730
okay, um, but no, not really, we do not tell tales like that. And there are no experiences like that are there in our reality, we understand that in the cosmos, there are different kinds of beings. Some of them are expressing themselves in very negative ways, I suppose you would call horrifying or scary, and we are aware of some of them.

144
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:49,830
But it isn't within our culture to experience or express or discuss them in any other way other than as an observation of what it is that they are choosing to do within themselves for various reasons.

145
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:59,970
So like when you were talking about having simulation experiences for first contact? Yes. So did they ever give you any scary

146
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,390
simulations will know because there would be no point in making first contact with those civilizations.

147
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:36,570
Now, again, in making contact with Earth, there were scenarios that were presented that certainly confused us. Because they were so alien to our experience. And at first, we didn't actually believe the scenarios, we thought they were testing us to see if what they were giving us might just be made up. When we realized it wasn't made up. It was a little bit of a shock.

148
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:59,310
But that's about as far as it goes for us. Worried about it like a simulation where you, you know, like you said, you did they don't want to send you out before you have a little experience. Yes, so you don't mess up is but remember, we rely on our connections to simultaneous incarnations to do that.

149
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,260
You understand?

150
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:50,160
Well, in other words, you already know that any society we're going to make first contact with, we have a life in that society first. So that we can absorb the understanding of the positive, the negative, the neutral of that society, so that you won't be so alien to us and we won't be so alien to you. That's why again, euphemistically, the channel is one of my past lives so that in his experience of living on Earth, I can access that information and those experiences to be able to relate to you, and so that you can relate to us without those incarnational experiences in the societies that we choose to contact. We would simply be to alien to one another. We wouldn't understand one another. There would be no common ground, there would be no translation.

151
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:59,970
So if you were experiencing a simulation in your early training experience, yes. And you didn't know it was a simulation. Yes. So

152
00:37:00,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Always, they didn't always tell you it was the simulation. They do it in that way so that our responses will be real. So we understand going in that it's going to be a simulation. But the master, who then conducts the telepathic simulation contains an element in that simulation that makes it seem to be happening for real. Otherwise, our reactions are not accurate. Exactly. So were you ever put into challenging situations? And but you didn't get scared? Well, no, there was no reason to get scared. There might have been many reasons to be puzzled for a while, but there's no reason to get scared. We understand going in that anything has an answer. There's always an alternative. We're taught that first. Remember, we have the basics going in, first of how things work, so that we can apply the principles the instruction manual, in our own simulation. So there

153
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:37,260
no reason for us to choose to be afraid of what's going to happen no matter how it looks. And some of our military they train, you know not to panic. Because panic kills. Yes. So this is a similar idea, then we'll sort of but we're not trained to not panic. Yeah, because you wouldn't panic correct as you wouldn't get afraid. We are trained to understand that there is simply no reason to choose to panic. It makes no sense to us. It's that ingrained. It's sort of the difference between a stable consciousness and a consciousness moving towards towards stability. Yes.

154
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:42,510
We are not moving towards stability, but we are I know.

155
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:47,700
Yes. So anymore.

156
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:00,000
No, no, no, I just was trying to find another question.

157
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:43,560
That I hadn't. Okay. So after finishing the 30 days cryptic meditation negative people started coming to this individual and interfering in their behavior, interfering with that trying opportunity to express what you've learned in the meditations about becoming a cryptic, so the person wanted to know how to be sure on the full moon. I'm not connecting with those or other negative beings How To be sure, yes, you're talking about the idea of what we suggested about going to Joshua Tree or some other full moon. I, I think it's Joshua Tree. Well, then the certainty is to not go.

158
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:58,830
Well, if you're going to carry with you a belief system that says that you might be in danger on the full moon, in Joshua Tree, don't go and then you will be certain not to have that experience.

159
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,640
couldn't be simpler.

160
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:15,990
Okay, well, um, yes. I'd love to go back and look at some of the other questions from yesterday in case we had a few. Yes, but

161
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:29,160
but it would take me a moment to we have someone else ask a question and I'll know, okay, I'll see this nice. Their timing is different.

162
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:34,140
Okay, I got I got it. So maybe I can come up with a few here.

163
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,200
Unless you're done.

164
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,020
How perceptive of

165
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:52,320
it is actually time for your short break before the holotape meditation. Okay. So take a short break, we will resume this transmission. Then.

166
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,970
See everyone in 15

167
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,720
minutes.

168
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:14,340
Don't say let us continue this transmission. Now, first and foremost, before we begin with the meditation,

169
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:26,760
the electronic experience that you had when we disconnected from the channel, is because we didn't completely disconnect.

170
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:39,780
We thought we'd give you a tiny taste of what's coming up on the 13th with regard to the idea of our presence being a little bit closer, by allowing you

171
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,130
to match our heartbeat.

172
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:46,680
So

173
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:59,970
this is the very beginning of things to come expressed first in the energy of your devices, but coming closer and closer

174
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,250
And closer.

175
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,130
Don't be scared

176
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,190
unless you find it fun.

177
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,250
And now, allow yourselves to relax.

178
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:29,190
Let go of the cares of the dare. Take a deep breath in and let it out.

179
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:38,790
And continue to breathe deeply and easily as you allow your lights to shift and your music to play

180
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,180
and to begin

181
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,190
the journey

182
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,550
to the portal

183
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:51,990
after midnight, under the hunter's moon,

184
00:42:53,340 --> 00:43:00,000
because you can begin to project yourselves there now ahead of the physical

185
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,650
Date since all things are here, and now.

186
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:08,940
So be with us now.

187
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:17,400
In that vortex in Joshua Tree at midnight, under the full hunters

188
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:26,280
stand upon the ground, sit upon the ground lie upon the ground, whatever is your wish

189
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:34,380
and gaze up at the stars and the moon in the clouds of the night sky.

190
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,740
As you feel the energy bill

191
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,530
with anticipation

192
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:46,680
of an opening

193
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:48,810
of a door

194
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,900
slowly opening

195
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:56,700
wider

196
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,220
and wider

197
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,140
And wider.

198
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:10,230
So that you may see through to the other side, a dimensional doorway, a portal, a vortex

199
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,950
and on the other side,

200
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:19,530
other forms of consciousness peeking through that door and you

201
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:24,150
watching, observing,

202
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:29,190
feeling the invitation you have settled

203
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,940
by the opening of the door

204
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:42,870
and that consciousness passes through the door, crossing the threshold into your reality

205
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:46,500
still hovering in the sky

206
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:52,470
observing you all and awaiting the signals

207
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:58,740
receiving the signals the vibrations the frequencies

208
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,990
Your inner being,

209
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:08,370
letting those frequencies wash over and through the other consciousness,

210
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:11,520
taking it in, absorbing,

211
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:13,410
feeling it,

212
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:18,060
reading it,

213
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,010
and then

214
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,610
silently at first

215
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,850
and then, as always

216
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:30,450
speaking to you,

217
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:36,180
casting spells of energy, in the language of light,

218
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:47,670
crystallize in your consciousness as symbols, images, feelings, translations, ideas, imagining

219
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:55,590
uncharted territories unfold in the map of your mind

220
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:59,970
as the stars across the sky

221
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:08,970
connected in your imagination two lines of light, forming asterism constellation

222
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:18,780
that allow you to chart a course not only upon your planet, but through the cosmos

223
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:23,280
to rise upward,

224
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:33,060
whether standing sitting or lying down to rise up or to meet, the consciousness that descends towards you

225
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:38,820
to feel your heart open

226
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,650
as its heart opens to you

227
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:45,990
and to meet

228
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,500
in the middle, in the sky,

229
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:53,460
in the stars in the clouds in the night

230
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:56,040
under the light of the moon

231
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:00,000
that illuminates not only the last

232
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,380
Escape around you.

233
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,960
But the soul within

234
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:06,720
the mind within

235
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:09,120
the spirit within,

236
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:12,720
illuminates every cell of your being.

237
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:15,990
And calls for

238
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:18,150
the true self.

239
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,200
We're not it says,

240
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:28,410
For we are your family. We are those parts of yourself

241
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:34,110
that you do not yet know. But will come

242
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,440
to understand will come

243
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:39,330
together we

244
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:43,800
will come to know deeply

245
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:50,850
and the more deeply you know yourself, the more deeply you will know us.

246
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,090
We are but mirrors

247
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:59,280
and in us is reflected

248
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,650
The grace

249
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,590
and potential

250
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:07,140
of European

251
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:12,930
dance with us now about the star.

252
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:19,860
Be open in your vision and your senses to go beyond

253
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:30,660
what you normally conceive of as your reality, to drop the veils and the barriers and see coming forth

254
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:36,210
spread of lightens, spread of stars

255
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:40,740
that are not stars, but beings of consciousness.

256
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:51,300
And though the stars themselves also have their own form and expression of consciousness,

257
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:58,680
these come to you as extensions as sparks of light and life.

258
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:04,320
And as you meet them and as you match them,

259
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:08,250
the spark within you ignites

260
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,470
and shall forevermore burn bright

261
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,970
and shall forevermore be with it

262
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,190
as a light in the lantern that lights your way that lights your path,

263
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,590
the path that is you

264
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:30,720
be open on this night, under the hunter's moon.

265
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:35,670
For what you are hunting for is yourself.

266
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:39,210
What you seek is more.

267
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:49,110
It is not a game that you want, but knowledge of the game that you play

268
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,300
on Earth.

269
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:56,730
knowledge of the scene you have chosen to explore

270
00:49:58,290 --> 00:49:59,790
under the hunter's moon

271
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:02,190
can be revealed.

272
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:12,510
You can find your place upon the earth in the grand scheme of the game

273
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:34,770
and allow yourselves to play out yourself chosen freewill destiny. As you the unique you that is now held in the sight of other consciousnesses other hearts other minds other souls other spirits other beings.

274
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:38,670
We hold you in our hearts

275
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:42,480
Welcome

276
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:44,940
to our world

277
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,910
as you welcome us to you

278
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:56,220
we meet here in this place at this time

279
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,970
under this move in this light

280
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,950
This meaning shall be forever here and now.

281
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:13,860
So that even as you walk your path, in the light of day

282
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:16,050
the hunter's moon

283
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:21,390
shall clean within you, glow within you.

284
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:36,720
attract you magnetize to more of yourself, to hunt for those pieces within you that will allow you to connect,

285
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:43,380
to integrate, to join, to blend, to harmonize

286
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,290
and to constantly

287
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:48,630
with curiosity

288
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:57,840
burning in your heart to seek more and more and more of your

289
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,970
See yourself reflected

290
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,660
in the million shards

291
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,120
of the shattered mirror,

292
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,390
that is all that is.

293
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,320
That are the stars in the sky.

294
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,710
The mirrors that reflect the spark within each and every one of you

295
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:32,430
come to this place.

296
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,730
This

297
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,280
is the first meeting of many that shall grow

298
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:43,740
and crystallize

299
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,830
into physical form.

300
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:49,830
One day

301
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:53,190
not too far away

302
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:59,940
so be here now in this place

303
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:04,380
At this time, and on this day

304
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,290
13th of October

305
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:18,450
the ending of an old cycle and the beginning of a new

306
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:28,110
that begins with your year 24 within that is not only

307
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:34,950
the promise of perfect vision of a future,

308
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:44,610
but the clarity of hindsight from which you can learn to be here and now in the present.

309
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:51,630
Using the power of the illusion of the past and the future, to inform yourself

310
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:54,870
of the knowledge you need

311
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:56,730
to hear

312
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:11,460
Be at peace, enjoy

313
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:15,630
and feel the beating of your hearts

314
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,280
as you breathe in

315
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:25,140
and out

316
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:36,120
and journey deeper than ever before, into the great mystery

317
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:38,310
of all that.

318
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:49,650
Continue now as your light, fade and your music fades into the night.

319
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,950
The night of doctors

320
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:56,160
continue to flow

321
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,910
and dream and

322
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:01,680
just

323
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:03,360
just

324
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:05,370
just be

325
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:13,980
surrounded,

326
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,740
that encompasses

327
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:19,650
focus

328
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:23,910
and that nurtures at that blesses

329
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:25,950
insight

330
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:30,750
shall guide you

331
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:35,970
on your journey with us

332
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:55,140
In the deepest, darkest, most fearsome

333
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:02,190
You will discover nothing
